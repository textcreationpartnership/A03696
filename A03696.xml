            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The parable of the vniuſt Steward doth not warrant any pickery or vnfaithfulnes in ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but only doth implie, that as hee made him friends vniuſtly; ſo wee ſhould both iuſtly and wiſely make vs friends of this Mammon of wealth, v. 9. by diſperſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;<note place="margin">Ver. 9.</note> that the fountaines of our liberalitie may runne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to all that neede, <hi>Prou.</hi> 5.16:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Phariſes, that were couetous, hearing this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 14.</note> 
               <hi>v.</hi> 14. thought that Chriſt ſpake fooliſhly, and dangerouſly in ſo ſaying, they could not endure that their ſore of couetouſnes ſhould be touched; and, when his hand came neere it, they put it from them with a ſcoffe, and mocked him: they would neuer beleeue but any man might ſerue God, and gather riches; or how ſhould the Common-wealth ſtand? and how ſhould one man bee aboue another? or,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4441:4"/>would hee haue all men alike? as if they had thus reaſoned againſt him, as againſt one that ſpake both abſurdly and impiouſly.<note place="margin">Ver. 15.</note> But verſ. 15. hee tels them, that deſire of riches and loue of themſelues, had ſo blinded them, that they ſawe not where they were, nor in what dangerous wayes: and that becauſe they held themſelues wiſe, therefore they iudged him fooliſh, and his doctrine (that was wiſe) ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: but that that pleaſed them, God abhorred: and ſo he commeth to the Scripture, now read, v. 19. which I take to be, not any ſtory or thing done, but as was ſaid, a parable where his chiefe purpoſe is to diſſwade theſe Phariſes from cruell hardnes and a carnall life by the example of this rich man, hung vp (as it were) in chaines in hell for a terrour to others, becauſe he fed himſelfe curiouſly, and fed not poore <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And heere vnder the perſons of the rich man and <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> we haue two ſorts or ſtates of men; ſuch as were then in the world, are now, and ſhall be to the end of time. In both which, we may note their different ſtates, and that which is common to them: their different ſtates are heere on the earth, or after they left. It in their liues they differed very much, and after their deaths, much more: for, the rich man was finely clothed, or clothed with ſoft and gorgeous rayment: and for his fare, it was delicate and of the beſt eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. v. 19. the beggar and <hi>Lazarus</hi> was vexed with ſores and hunger, deſiring the courſeſt bread, or crummes of bread that fel from the richmans table. v. 20.21. After death, the beggars ſoule was glorified in the boſom of <hi>Abraham,</hi> being caried thither by the Angels: but of his buriall there is no mention. The richmans body was gloriouſly buried in the earth, and his ſoule pittifully buried in hel. v. 22.23. and this is common to both, that they both died. v. 22.</p>
            <p>Thus ſtandeth the ſcope and ſumme of theſe fiue firſt verſes,<note place="margin">Luc. 16.19</note> and the ſumme of all is to aduiſe men to ſpend their goods well, and not vpon their luſts: not to forget mercy, and to be liberall to Chriſts poore, that their fountaines, that is, their eſtate and poſſeſſions may be bleſſed vnto
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4441:4"/>them <hi>Prou.</hi> 5.18. But, let vs returne to the rich man, and heare what is ſaid of him.</p>

            <p>The text ſpeaketh of a certaine rich man, but without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny name; or of a rich man, not named: becauſe (as one ſaith) God takes no care of the wicked, <hi>neither remembreth their names.</hi>

Our apparell was giuen vs to hide our nakednes; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.21. which nakednes came from our fall and ſinne: and ſhall we glory in that, which at firſt was, and to this day, is the couer of our ſhame?

Therefore to make ſo much of our ſhame, and with ſo great neglect of better duties to our neighbour and the poore, ſo to trimme it, what is it but an intollerable and cruell vanitie?

Indeede, the <hi>intemperance</hi> of all our <hi>ſtrange apparell</hi> is from our heart; but when our heart hath once <hi>laid it vpon our backe,</hi> we may reade an intemperate heart there: and ſo long as the <hi>leafe is greene on the top of the tree,</hi> we know that all <hi>ſappe is not gone downe to the roote.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when we ſee ſuch ſtreamers of pride in ſo many gariſh tires and attirings of men and women, and of women ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially; we may ſay there dwelles a proud heart, a vaine heart, a wanton heart, and a heart of no modeſtie or good ſtay. Such was the clothing of this rich man; which is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore branded by the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> vnder the names of <hi>purple and fine linnen,</hi> and vnder the daily and wanton vſe of ſuch pride ſwolne clothes. Heerein, there is no doubt, but hee offended greatly; but heerein expreſly and principally, that in all this waſte and glory of apparell, he was cruell to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus:</hi> and in this, he hath but too many followers at this day, who carry all good houſekeeping with them in their trunkes to London, or ſome other great Citie or Towne that they purpoſe to liue in, and not at the <hi>Ephrathah</hi> of their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4441:7"/>owne home, <hi>Ruth.</hi> 4.11.

            <p>What, euery day? and that ſumptuouſly, or choiſely euery day? this was a double ſinne: one, that he was giuen ſo much to his bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y; another, that he was giuen ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to it: one that he fed ſo curiouſly and daintily; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that he fed ſo, not at certaine times, but daily: and by ſuch filling of the belly with meates, and ſtuffing of the head with drinkes, made himſelfe altogether vnfit for any good duti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s in his calling. I doe not ſay but the cup may ſometimes ouerflow: and that a Chriſtian may be more cheerefull, and feede more liberally at one time, then at another. For, euen Chriſt at a marriage in <hi>Cana,</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a more liberall and full diet, then at another time hee would haue done, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.9. But how doth this iuſtifie that <hi>fulnes of bread</hi> which was <hi>Sodoms,</hi> and this <hi>rich mans ſinne? Ezech.</hi> 16.49. Or, how doth it warrant at any time, any ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of Gods feare? and if no ſuch eating at any time, how much leſſe then any comonnes this way? Two things therefore are reproueable in this voluptuous rich man. The firſt, that he was ſo curious for his belly: the ſecond, that he was euery day ſo, for which his ſoule is in hell.</p>
            <p>Out of both which we learne,<note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note> that all abuſe of meates and drinkes to exceſſe, is a ſinne to hell. In the 13. Chapter to the Romanes, the <hi>Apoſtle of the Gentiles,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> hauing exhorted ſuch beleeuers at Rome as had <hi>put on the armour of light,</hi> to keepe the path of life; ſaith, Not in gluttony and drunkennes: as if he had ſaid, theſe are out of your way to ſaluation: walke therefore honeſtly, that is, in temperance, and not in theſe, if you meane to be ſaued, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.13. From whence it muſt needes follow, that they offend to damnation, who drinke as much as a Horſe, and not ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly as hee: and who make it their exerciſe to eate and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4441:8"/>drinke: eating as beaſts, who eate all the day and part of the night. But the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaketh plainely as much, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. telling the Church to which he there wrot, that their end is damnation, whoſe belly is their God. For, theſe are the vncleane hogges that the Diuels of intemperance enter into, and <hi>carie with violence</hi> into the great <hi>deepe, Luc.</hi> 8.33. So <hi>Eſau,</hi> louing his belly ſo much, and the bleſſing ſo little, is ſir-named prophane, or one that could not be ſaued, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.16. And, what doth our Sauiour meane, <hi>Luc.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for this, ſome haue not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly compared our Tap houſes and Tauernes (as men vſe them now) to the <hi>lawe of the aſſe in Sampſons hand,</hi> which laid the <hi>Philiſtimes heapes vpon heapes, Iudg.</hi> 15.16.

But that all abuſe of the creature to exceſſe is a ſinne to hell, may further bee proued.</p>
            <p>The reaſons. For (firſt) it is a waſte of the good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, abuſing that to ſinne which might haue comforted many, perhaps, haue ſaued the liues of ſome. And what are ſuch but theeues to their brethren, <hi>Prou.</hi> 3.27, and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of their brethren, and themſelues? He that robbes a man of that which is his, is a theefe: And ſuch theeues are they that eate the poore, that is, that which is theirs, at their tables of exceſſe. So hee that keepes away the oile from the lampe, puts it out as well as he that quencheth it with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and ſuch are they, who deuoure that bread which is the poore mans life: their hand is in his blood as well as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4441:8"/>theirs, who oppreſſe him to death by taking away his bread. Now, doe theeues and murtherers offend to damnation: and doe not voluptuous theeues, and murtherers offend ſo too? Secondly, ſuch an abuſe of the creature <hi>oppreſſeth the heart with ſurfetting and drunkennes:</hi> and how can the heart ſo oppreſſed, and perſon liuing in ſuch a trade of exceeding, looke to be ſaued? Thirdly, it is flat idolatrie, making the belly a God. Old idolaters turned the image of a beaſt into God, and theſe new, turne the image of God into a beaſt. But idolatrie is a ſinne; and are not idolaters ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners vnto hell? Fourthly, it is a chaine to adultery to drawe it in. For ſuch eaters in exceſſe, and drinkers out of meaſure cannot be<note n="(b)" place="margin">Prou. 23.30.33.</note> chaſte perſons; or there is no ſleeping in theſe, and watching againſt adultery: and who can lay on more fewell but hee ſhall haue a greater flame? <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.8.

The body is but the garment of the ſoule: and is the garment better then the body, the body then the ſoule? Or is not the body more worth then raiment? and ſo the body leſſe worth then the ſoule, being but the raiment of it? Why then is there ſo much care for the belly to feede it, when the ſoule is ſo little cared for, to ſaue it? ſpecially ſeeing that in ſuch care of our bellies, and little care of our ſoules, we can haue no hope to be ſaued?

In our quaffing cuppes, we ſacrifice to health, and ſpeake of healths, when we prepare for nothing leſſe, and the contrarie followeth; wherein we doe as ſome of the heathen did in the daies of ſacrifice to their idols for health: for ſacrificing for health, they banqueted drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the preiudice of their health.

One telles a tale of a certaine Bird, which hath the face of a man, and yet is ſo fierce of nature, that ſometime in her hunger ſhe will prey vpon Man. This Bird (ſaith my Author) comming to the water to drinke, and ſeeing a face in it (which is her owne) like the face of that Man which before ſhe deuoured; in great ſorrow for one ſlain by her ſo like her ſelfe, ſhe neuer after either eats or drinkes, but beates herſelfe to death. I will not iuſtifie the tale: but me thinkes all drunkards and great deuourers, (not for any want, as that Bird, but for wanton and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleaſures) ſhould conceiue great ſorrow; greater then that Bird did, for killing of one; not like themſelues, but their very ſelues. Me thinkes, if they would ſee that face in their cuppes of wine, and glaſſes of ſtrong drinke, the face of that Chriſtian man, whoſe graces and vertues, ſo many in one man, they haue beene the death of; they could not, (hauing reaſon, which the Bird we ſpake of hath not, and being greater murtherers by farre) but pierce themſelues through with many ſorrowes, not to death, but to true life by ſound repentance. Or, how can they heare either of a ſtrong man, or a ſober man, or a wiſe man, and not be wounded with ſtings of horrible feare, in the loude crie of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4441:10"/>their conſciences, telling them that they haue ſlaine ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men in themſelues? And may they not ſay: of wiſe, we haue made our ſelues fooles; of ſtrong, weake; of ſober by calling, drunken and more then brutiſh by the cuſtome of ſinne? But when they ſhall enter into meditation of a farre worſe eſtate, by ſuch luſts in the body cruelly pulled vpon them to damnation, if God be not mercifull to them; nay if they be not mercifull to themſelues to weepe preſently and bitterly for all their vnſober conuerſation, and turne to God, in a iuſt hatred of a courſe of life ſo murderous and vngodly: I ſay, when they ſhal thinke rightly of their eſtate ſo pittifull and terrible, cauſed by themſelues; how can they but be amazed with a horrible dread, and ſo paſſe the reſt of their dayes in feare, that they come not into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</p>
            <p>But (ſpecially) this cruell rich man was condemned in that which he did, becauſe he did it with the contempt of the poore. Then, though a man goe not apparelled as this man did, nor fare as he fared, that is, ſumptuouſly or choiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euery day: yet, if with him, he forget to ſtretch out his hand to the needy, he may be damned as he was: though he haue not that which he had, yet if he lacke that which he had not, namely, the care of the poore, he may goe to hell. For, there are more waies to hell then one: and the vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, as well as the theefe and murtherer ſhall goe thither. Not only hee that getteth his goods ill; but he that ſpends them ill and wantonly, or holds them in couetouſly and cruelly, when there is neede of his mercy, ſhall beare his condemnation, whoſoeuer he be. We may ſee it heere in this rich man: for we doe not reade either that he gate his riches and wealth ill, or tooke any thing by oppreſſion from the poore and <hi>Lazarus;</hi> it was ſufficient matter to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation in hell, that he did not vſe his riches well, and to the reliefe of the poore in miſerie.</p>
            <p>Where learne againe,<note place="margin">Doctr. 2.</note> that Chriſtians (if they would not be damned) muſt not onely not oppreſſe the poore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, but relieue, and doe for them in their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4441:10"/>as God hath dealt the meaſure vnto them of his power and gift to doe it with. For the ſentence of the great day proceedeth againſt the damned on Chriſts left hand, in this forme of words: <hi>Depart from me yee accurſed into euer laſting fire.</hi> The reaſon is giuen: <hi>For I was an hungred, and yee gaue me no meate: I thirsted, and yee gaue me no drinke: I was a stranger, and yee lodged me not: naked, and yee clothed me not: ſicke, and in priſon, and yee viſited me not.</hi> The Iudge doth not ſay; I was hungry, and yee tooke away my bread: and thirſty, and yee deceiued me of my drinke: or, I was har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourles, becauſe yee made me ſo: and naked, for you kept away my clothes. Nor doth he ſay; I was ſicke, and yee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted me, nor yee caſt me into priſon; but I was ſicke and in priſon, and yee came not to me. So the inhabitants of <hi>Meroz</hi> were accurſed; not for taking part with the enimie, but for <hi>not taking the Lords part against his enimies, Iudg.</hi> 5.23. And the <hi>axe is laid to the roote of euery tree that bringeth forth no good fruit,</hi> though it bring forth no bad, <hi>for the cutting of it downe to death &amp; hell, Mat.</hi> 3.10, though Chriſtians, who ſhould be trees of righteouſnes in the Church, as it were garden of God, beare no euil fruit, yet if they beare no good, there hangeth ouer their heads an axe of cutting downe: Our good workes cannot ſaue vs; but our euill, or want of good, are able to condemne vs. This plea in mans Court, that we haue done no man harme, is good: but it will not hold in that Court, where not onely the euill done is iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but the good vndone muſt be anſwered for. To this agreeth that prouerbiall ſpeech of <hi>Salomon: He that turneth away his care from the crie of the poore,</hi> he ſaith not, he that makes him cry, <hi>ſhal cry himſelfe, and not be heard, Prou.</hi> 21.13. That is, though he fall into ſuch miſerie as ſhall make him crie, and that to God and man for helpe; yet neither God nor man ſhall helpe him. So it is proued, not only that we ſhould not hurt the poore, if we will be ſaued; but that, (as their needes ſhall require) we muſt helpe them, to our beſt abilitie, if we will not periſh with the cruell that cannot be ſaued.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:4441:11"/>
            <p>The reaſons are. Euery breach of the commandement deſerueth hell and ſecond death: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, and this is one: Secondly, and more particularly; to omit this duty when there is cauſe, and we haue abilitie, what is it but with ſinne, to keepe in our hands that which is Gods part, and the poores portion; and ſo to be guilty of, both ſacrilege againſt God, and robbery againſt men? <hi>Prou.</hi> 3.27. When God makes vs rich, he makes vs but rich Stewards, with a charge not to keepe the Maiſters goods in our owne hands, but to giue them to the proper owners, the poore. Neither is it robbery onely to neglect this ſeruice of God to Gods poore, but a kind of murther: <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 34.22, or a killing of thoſe by cruelty, whoſe liues we might ſaue by almes. If then, either theft, or ſacriledge, or murther, or all three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue death eternall; then that which is all the three, not to miniſter to the neceſſities of Gods poore, deſerueth it. Thirdly, the <hi>vnfruitfull tree is cut downe for the fire. Math.</hi> 3: 10, and ſo muſt all vnfaithfull, that is, vnworking Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be for hel-fire.</p>

His reaſon is: the <hi>poore are our fleſh, Eſa.</hi> 58.7. Brethren are neere; but our ſelues are nearere. One bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may doe for another: but who is ſo vnkind that he will not doe for himſelfe? It is a fruite of the <hi>ſpirit to couer the naked with a garment: Ezech.</hi> 18.7: but ſigne of an <hi>ill ſpirit to vncouer him,</hi> or to keepe his couer from him: And he is no good man who hauing two coates, will not giue one, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſee <hi>his brother periſh</hi> for want of one, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.11. Our Sauiour, who being rich, <hi>made himſelfe poore to make vs rich,</hi> will haue <hi>vs to giue almes of ſuch things as we haue, Luk.</hi> 11.41. That is, he requireth vs to giue almes, either in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or in that which is money worth. And therefore, in <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.33, he bids vs <hi>ſell that we haue,</hi> that we may haue to giue to ſuch as neede. For ſome might ſay, I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4441:12"/>giue ſomething to Chriſt in his poore, but I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to giue. Therefore ſaith Chriſt; you ſay you haue nothing to giue; but haue you nothing to ſell? no corne in your Barne? no ſtuffe in your houſe? If any, rather then your brother ſhould periſh, ſell it, and when it is ſold, giue it to him. Neither doth Chriſt ſimply command this, but with promiſe of a recompence, who may command with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. For he ſaith: Giue out of theſe bagges, and I will giue you other and better bagges. And it is ſure, if we lay vp a penny in heauen, we ſhall find a pound there: he that ſcatters there ſhall find a large increaſe. If we ſowe anything vpon Chriſt Ieſus, the ſeede of reliefe that is caſt vpon him, is beſtowed vpon a thankfull ſoile; it will returne with v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury what we lay out vpon it. Chriſt is no barren ground, and a cup of cold water ſowen vpon him, will riſe to the great harueſt of a cup of glory. Alſo and further, for the temporall returne, the Lord by <hi>Eſay</hi> tels vs, that, <hi>If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the hungry and troubled ſoule, hee will ſatisfie our ſoule in drought, and make our bones fat; and we ſhalbe like ſprings of water, whoſe waters faile not. Eſa.</hi> 58.10. Heere are very large promiſes, and he that maketh them is faithfull, for is it not a great bleſſing of God to be prouided of ſprings of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a great drouth? is not the fatting of the bones, in ſome common leanneſſe ſent vpon others for a puniſhment, ſomething worth? Is it not good prouidence to lay vp that in our daies of plenty, which will be ſure, not onely to come againe, but to watch the time, when for our neede, it ſhall be moſt welcome to vs? and who would not giue, ſo to receiue againe? But all this is promiſed here by the Lord vnder the broad ſeale of his word. And why ſhould wee (then) be ſo ſlacke in the liberall laying out of ſomething for an euill day? why ſhould we feare to caſt our bread vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch waters, where it will be found againe? and to make <hi>God our pay-maiſter by giuing to his poore, Prou.</hi> 19.17, ſeeing all that we ſo giue ſhall be repaid ſo ſurely, and with ſuch increaſe? But further to prouoke vs to a worke of charitie ſo gainfull, and ſo commanded: let vs remember that it is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4441:13"/>not onely a deede of mercy, but worke of iuſtice to giue to Gods poore: ſo ſaith <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 112.9; where he telles vs that a good man is alway doing good, and that his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, that is, worke thereof abideth euer; and not for a while, or for a few good fits. By righteouſnes, he meaneth the worke of mercy to the poore, which hee calleth not changeable, but conſtant mercy: and he calleth it righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, becauſe it is not an arbitratie but commanded du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: nor at our owne choiſe, which we may doe, or leaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; but ſtraightly enioined. And therefore as the rich haue right to the maine eſtate by Gods bounty; ſo the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, and that which they may ſpare, is the poores by vertue of that donation. That therefore which they may ſpare is not their owne, but the poores; from whom, if with this rich man and merciles, they withhold the crummes of their ſuperfluitie, with him they may cry, when there ſhall be no <hi>bearing.</hi> Looke <hi>I am.</hi> 5.1. I tell thee, the poore haue as good right to the waſte bread of thy eſtate, as thou haſt to the full table it ſelfe; and it is ratified to them by the ſame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that the larger portion is ſealed vnto thee.

But to proceede a little farther: Chriſt Ieſus in his laſt day of iudgement, wil pronounce that to be done to himſelfe which is done to his poore, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.40: and contrarily, that to be taken from him, which is <hi>denied to them, v.</hi> 45. Now tell me, if Chriſt himſelfe ſhould come to begge lodging of thee, wouldſt thou not giue him lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and (if need were) the vſe of thine owne bed? When a poore Chriſtian doth as much, it is all one, as if Chriſt did ſo by him: and therefore what thou denieſt to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, thy Sauiour will take as denied to himſelfe in that Chriſtian, and ſay; <hi>Foraſmuch as yee did it not to the leaſt of theſe, yee did not to me;</hi> therefore <hi>ſhall yee goe into euerlaſting paine, as the righteous ſhall paſſe to life eternall, Mat.</hi> 25.45.46. But, leſt any ſhould thinke himſelfe not to be charged with giuing becauſe he is not rich, the Apoſtle <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſheweth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4441:13"/>that this duty belongeth both to rich and poore, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. Where the poore labouring man is commanded to practiſe loue, and the duties of loue vpon his needy brother. And if we would haue an example for it, we haue a good one in the <hi>poore widow who cast her two mites into the coffer of the poore, which was all the ſubſtanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This poore man may be the patterne or mould of that other ſtate of men which we ſhall haue alwayes with vs: but ſo, as by neither ſtates of rich or poore, it can be knowne or <hi>iudged whether a man be loued or hated of God, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1. For no man can ſay: This is a rich man, therefore God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him.</p>
               <p>My reaſon is, the one of theſe was rich, and not loued; not becauſe he was rich, but becauſe he was naught: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was loued, though poore; not becauſe he was poore, but becauſe he was good. So that this diuerſitie of ſtates is indifferent, and from God: prouided that the rich man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come lawfully rich, and the poore man be made poore as <hi>Lazarus</hi> heere, by ſickneſſe and ſores, not by any intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſpendings.</p>
               <p>And this teacheth that pouerty and riches are not ſimply euill,<note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note> but by abuſe. <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Ioſeph, Iob,</hi> and others were rich men, and yet good men: And <hi>Ruth</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> were poore, and not euill. <hi>Paul</hi> an excellent Apoſtle, and yet a poore man, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8: Alſo, <hi>Peter,</hi> a worthy Apoſtle, ſaid to the poore creeple; Siluer and gold I haue none: and rich <hi>Salomon</hi> was a figure of the riches which we haue in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The reaſons. The <hi>Lord maketh poore, and maketh rich:</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.7: or, <hi>the poore and rich together,</hi> as paſſingers who comming from coutrarie quarters, meete in one mid way: and ſo he that is rich to day, may be poore to morrow: but what followes? The Lord is the maker of them both: That is, he that made them, makes this change in them, <hi>Prou.</hi> 22.2. Now what God hath made, or doth make cannot be euill. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:4441:14"/>
               <p>Secondly, it is good that ſome ſhould be full to giue, and ſome empty to receiue what is giuen, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.11. And if no man were in want, who ſhall be ſerued? and who would doe ſeruice, as now, neceſſitie compelling them? or, how could mercy be ſhewed, if there were not any to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe mercy on?</p>
               <p>Thirdly; God that by his lawe hath forbidden to ſteale, doth by the ſame lawe allowe to a man his intereſt and peace in that which is his, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.15. And if he haue ſuch title to it by Gods allowance: his hauing of it cannot be ſimply euill.</p>

If our purſe be full of money, and our ſoule be as full of wickednes, what better are we? or rather how much worſe? For, we haue euill in our heart, and more opportunities by a wealthy eſtate (being euill) to vtter it: A rich euill man may farre goe beyond a poore euill man in deedes of wickednes. And what doſt thou knowe what bad wares are in thy heart, which the venom of riches muſt needes make worſe, becauſe more communicable by the infectious aire of thy example and authoritie, being made rich and great? Which being ſo; what haſt thou gotten by thy wealth ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, but more weapons to wound thy ſoule deeper to death? Beſides; can thy riches ſaue thee from death? Heere we haue a man that was very rich, and yet died: or, can they deliuer thee from hell? Be as rich as thou maiſt, as rich as thou haue gone to hell. Nay, they cannot cure thee of a poore ague, or from the leaſt of Gods ſtroakes ſaue thee: how much leſſe can they ſaue thy body from death, or thy body and ſoule from eternall death?</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4441:15"/>were) by vſing our wealth to his diſhonour, and by truſting to the broken ſtaffe of riches. <hi>Trust not in robbery,</hi> ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid;</hi> and <hi>if riches increaſe, trust not in them, Pſal.</hi> 62.10. As if it were robbery, and ſo it is, and that againſt God, ſo to doe. <hi>Salomon</hi> likewiſe bids <hi>vs not to leane to our owne wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> that is, ſhifts or fetches: as if he had ſaid; though you haue wealth in abundance, and the world at will, truſt not to that; for what truſt is in that? but make God your truſt. Some take their wealth of God, and thanke the diuell for it; by giuing praiſe, with <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> to their gods of gold and ſiluer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.4; not to the true God who giues them their gold and ſiluer. Some alſo in neceſſitie, will bowe downe to ſinne, in one falſe tricke or other, to helpe themſelues. Such care not to lye and to diſſemble, and to ſweare falſely, or to ſweare anything for an aduantage: and ſome hauing abundance, truſt their whole weight vnto it, as to a ſtaffe that will neuer faile. But God breakes that ſtaffe ſuddenly which they thinke will hold euer, and in a moment, they are turned out of all. I need not to goe farre for examples; we haue inowe, dead and liuing; and let the liuing lay it to heart, whatſoeuer the dead did. And now (more particularly) for <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lazarus</hi> is deſcribed heere by certaine attributes, and effects. The attributes are, his miſerable condition of life: his name: and his ſores. The effects are proper to himſelfe, or out of himſelfe in other. The proper effects are, he lay at the rich mans gate houſe, and deſired a refreſhing from the crummes, or leauings of his full table. The miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this poore man was, that he was driuen to begge. The text ſaith, <hi>there was a certaine begger.</hi> God would not haue a begger in Iſrael: that is, he would haue none ſo much neglected in Chriſtian Iſrael, as that he ſhould be compelled to begge, or (begging) to goe from doore to doore. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was thus forced to begge, was the fault of the time, not his, who (being full of ſores) could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies doe.</p>
               <p>Which againe teacheth,<note place="margin">Doctr. 2.</note> that it is a corrupt time and ſtate
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4441:15"/>where the poore are not prouided for, but by begging at doores. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>He neuer ſawe the ſeede of the righteous begge, Pſal.</hi> 37.25. <hi>Dauid</hi> neuer ſawe it; and in a Church well ordered, it cannot be ſeene. <hi>The poore yee ſhall haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with you,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt, Ioh.</hi> 12.8. He ſaith, the poore, but not the begging poore: and the text of <hi>Deuter.</hi> 15.4, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly alledged againſt beggers in Iſrael according to the old Latine reading: but that the Iſrael of Gods Church ſhould haue no ſuch in it, may further appeare by theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>The reaſons: for firſt, it proclaimes the ſhame of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that ſhould prouide for their poore in other maner, that is, charitably at home, and not by clamour at doores.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it openeth a gappe to rogues and vagabonds, who vnder the colour of begging, will be of no certaine Church or ciuill companie, but in nature of Outlawes: and ſo as rotten armes and legges, ready to drop from the body, they ſeeme members, and are not.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Gods ordinance is, that the members of the Church ſhould haue their particular lawfull callings in it, and not liue like wanderers or ſtrayes in no calling. Laſtly, there is not onely a lawe in <hi>Moſes,</hi> but a ſtatute in England againſt it, <hi>Elizab.</hi> 39. Now if all this be ſo intollerable, it muſt needes be confeſſed, that it is a corrupt time and ſtate, wherein an abuſe ſo intollerable, is not reformed.</p>
               <p>By this it may be iudged,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label> that we now liue in a corrupt time of the Church, though the religion we profeſſe be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and good. For againſt the ſtature of the land and law of God, many are ſuffered to begge (not full of ſores as <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> here, and yet our ſhame ſhould be great if it were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waies;) but ſtrong and ſturdy beggers, men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who can giue no good account of their wandering life: Yea, many married vnder a hedge (if at all) are ſuffered without all ſhame and good conſcience, to increaſe the Church and Common-wealths ſtore with the ſeede of baſtardy, and vncleane copulation. Doth not this both preach to our eares, and proue to our faces, that ſomewhat
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4441:16"/>in the Church, and ſomewhat in the Common-wealth is out of courſe? Or is order reſpected, and good law execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as it ought, where ſuch vngodly diſſoluteneſſe is neither reſtrained, nor looked vnto? O that the ſword of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and the Magiſtrates ſharpe ſword of iuſtice were walking here: that both would acquite themſelues (as they are ordained) for the cutting off, or amendment of ſuch offendors: which I can but pray for, and ſo proceede: the name of this poore man followeth.</p>
               <q>Named Lazarus.</q>
               <p>We heard that the wicked rich mans name was not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, we heare what this godly poore mans name is. For it is here ſet downe in Gods regiſter, and ſaid to be <hi>Lazarus.</hi> And ſo we ſee (as was obſerued vpon the 19. verſe, the firſt doctrine) that where the righteous haue an honorable memoriall, the wicked haue none, or of no good ſauor; but as a ſnuffe, burning in the ſocket after the laſt flame of life. But this hath bin already ſpoken of. This good mans name is <hi>Lazarus,</hi> or <hi>Eleazar:</hi> by interpretation, Gods helpe. We ſay to our beggers, God helpe you; but God ſaith to them that be godly, and begge; I will helpe where man will not. And here we learne that the righteous,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> though poore, are reſpected of God: ſo are not the wicked, though rich. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> the father of belieuers, and himſelfe an excellent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuer, had not one foote of ground in the land wherein hee was a ſtranger; yet how rich became poore and vnlanded <hi>Abraham,</hi> by Gods fauour? Who was greater with God then he? and who was called the friend of God, as he? <hi>Eſay</hi> 41.8. <hi>Ruth</hi> was very poore; yet being poore and godly, how carefully did God looke vnto her, as in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and how richly in marriage, did hee beſtowe her? <hi>Ruth.</hi> 2.8.11.12.15.16. &amp; 3.10.11.15. &amp; 4.10.13. And doth not <hi>Annah,</hi> in her ſong, ſay; that <hi>God raiſeth vp the poore</hi> (ſhe meaneth the godly poore) <hi>out of the duſt, and lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vp the begger,</hi> that is, beggers ſuch as <hi>Lazarus</hi> the begger
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4441:16"/>was, to ſet them among Princes, <hi>and to make them inherite the ſeate of glory?</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.8. If we would haue more exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, there are a cloud of them in the holy ſtory. The ſcope of which, containing the couenants that are betweene God and his Church, giuen vnder the broad ſeales of the old and new Teſtament; doth ſhewe plainely and fully, that the righteous people in whoſe heart the Lords word is, are ſure alwaies of comfort and ſafety from him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſundry <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> as 119.1.2, &amp; 112.1, ſuch are called <hi>bleſſed;</hi> becauſe he that hath called them, will bleſſe them. With this, <hi>Dauid</hi> made his pillowe, when he lay downe to ſleepe: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.8: and in aſſurance of this, both <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the ſeede of <hi>Dauid</hi> had great confidence, in their greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie; knowing that they could not but do well, or be in ſafety whom the Prince himſelfe will countenance, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 6.6.11. Therefore the ſame <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſpeaking of a righteous perſon, promiſeth him, that the <hi>Lord will be his ſhield and buckler, Pſal.</hi> 91.4. Now, if God be the ſhield and buckler of the righteous, then they that ſtrike at them, muſt ſtrike through him, before they can come at them.</p>
               <p>The reaſons. The righteous are called Gods houſe, or temple, that is, his houſe of holineſſe: not which he ſetteth out to Tenants, but keepeth in his owne hands, and dwelles in himſelfe. Now, will a man ſuffer his enimie to beate his houſe downe vpon him, becauſe it is a poore one, if he can chuſe? But God can chuſe: and he that is righteous, though poore, is Gods pallace; and what feare then that he ſhall not be kept? or who dare offer to pull downe Gods houſe; the pallace which he reſpecteth ſo much, and not be ſure himſelfe to be pulled in pieces, when it ſhall ſtand? for he that is a wall of defence to his people, will be a wall of fire to his peoples enimies, <hi>Zechar.</hi> 9.8. &amp; 2.5. Secondly, the righteous, though poore, haue Gods image in them, and are as thoſe children that in moſt things reſemble their father. Now, if men loue thoſe children moſt that are moſt like them; will not God much reſpect his owne image, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelfe in a true Chriſtian? Thirdly, true Chriſtians,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4441:17"/>and new creatures in God, are <hi>Chriſts full brothers by father and mother.</hi> For by the mothers ſide they partake with him in fleſh, and in ſpirit by the fathers. Now if ſuch be full bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to Chriſt; then are they deare children to God in Chriſt, and he that is ſo well pleaſed with him, in him, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſpleaſed with them. Nay, if Chriſts halfe brothers (as I may ſay) <hi>partakers of fleſh as he,</hi> and comming from his creation, as men, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.14, haue ſo many ſhun ſhines of his common fauour in outward things; ſhall not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that are begotten with the word of truth, and haue a better nature poured into them then theſe ſonnes by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion haue, be farre more reſpected then they? and ſhall they not haue the double bleſſing, who haue iſſued from the wombe of God, in the regeneration? Fourthly, God ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and what he ſaid to him, is ſpoken to all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in him; <hi>Feare not Abraham,</hi> neither be afraide yee ſeede of <hi>Abraham, I am your buckler, and your exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Gen.</hi> 15.1. Now hee that is ſo to the righteous, muſt needes be much vnto them, and much tender them. Fiftly, the Lord hath made a couenant with ſuch as are godly (though they be poore, ſo they be poore and godly) of his ſaluation and bleſſing: and ſooner ſhall <hi>his couenant of the day and night be broken,</hi> ſooner ſhall <hi>it ceaſe to be day and night in their ſeaſons,</hi> then <hi>he will violate the couenant he hath made with his people of their ſafetie and peace, Ier.</hi> 33.16.20.21. But we ſee that God hath kept his word more then fiue thouſand yeeres for day and night: and will he, for that which is more deare vnto him by his owne mercy and the merit of his Sonne, goe from his promiſe to the righteous in their ſaluation? For <hi>ſaluation belongeth to the Lord, and this bleſſing is vpon his people, Pſal.</hi> 3.8.</p>

If then we would haue a ſure naile in Gods ſafetie, and not wauer or doubt when many are ſhaken, we muſt thus be eſtabliſhed. And who would not be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, when thouſands periſh? Euen <hi>Balaam</hi> would <hi>die the death of the righteous, Num.</hi> 23.10. He that loued not righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, deſired to die as the righteous: but becauſe he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his laſt end, whoſe beginnings &amp; middle to it, he neuer cared for, he had his end, not in peace as the righteous, but in blood: For he was ſlaine with the ſword of the children of Iſrael among the curſed <hi>Midianites, Num.</hi> 31.8. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies thought to be the beſt husbandry (and for worldly huſbandrie it is) moſt to affect that, that will be ſure to doe vs the moſt earthly good: and therefore if ſiluer be offered, we preferre it before braſſe; as we doe gold before ſiluer, if we may haue it. And he were but a foole or mad man, who running for a crowne of gold, would be caſt behind, for the taking vp of euery pin or point that might be laid in his way. This good husbandry would be ſeene in our care to be good, the onely way to be happy, and ſafe in dangers: and that other folly and madnes would be auoided in out race of religion, as the apparent <hi>loſſe of our crowne of glory,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24.25. &amp;c.

And what compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a crowne of gold, and the crowne of righteouſnes? Or, were it folly, yea madnes, for pinnes and trifles to loſe the prize of an earthly crowne: and is it not greater both folly and madnes for the trifling pinnes of this life to loſe the crowne of the next? and for vncertaine reſt, or rather certaine vnreſt, to aduenture, nay loſe all ſurety of true peace and ſound happines, here and hence? The Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſpeaketh of the happineſſe of our other life, magnifieth the ſame farre aboue all temporall felicities, both for worth and continaunce; and therefore calleth it a

               <p>And this teacheth, that ſuch Lazar-perſons in a Pariſh,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> as are full of ſores, ſicke at home, houſe-pent, or bed-rid, ſhould be viſited with the mercy of a common collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: or, they that are appointed in ſuch caſes Ouerſeers,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4441:19"/>ſhould come home to them, in perſon, ſee their wants and miſeries, and accordingly prouide for them out of that that is gathered for ſuch vſes: for ſeeing they cannot come to vs, is it not neceſſary wee ſhould ſend to them?</p>
               <p>And that there ſhould bee ſuch a common collection made, may bee prooued by the Apoſtles charge to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> which, in that Church, is giuen to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Church and Pariſh now; <hi>That euery one put aſide by himſelfe, and lay vp as God hath proſpered him:</hi> to wit, for common gatherings, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2.</p>
               <p>Alſo, that there ſhould bee ſuch ſending to the poore, without comming: for it is plaine by another charge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in this very matter, by godly <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who willed the people, in the <hi>day of their feaſt,</hi> and after they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues had <hi>eaten and drunke of the beſt, to ſend vnto them for whom none is prepared,</hi> Nehem. 8.10. Hee ſayeth, <hi>Sexd it:</hi> He ſayth not, <hi>Let them come to your doores to begge it.</hi> But ſome cannot come; and <hi>Lazarus</hi> (here) with much adoe came to the <hi>rich mans</hi> gate. Such ſhould be viſited by the godly rich in their poore and homely holes. So <hi>Iob,</hi> hee that is called the <hi>Father of the poore,</hi> for his mercies to the poore, did not onely feede and clothe thoſe whome hee knew to bee hungry and without couer; but, leſt any ſhould periſh, whom hee could not heare of, hee enquired with his tongue, and <hi>vſed his eyes to ſee them,</hi> Iob 31.17.19.

                  </gap>eth to be a neceſſary dutie in the richer Pariſhioners, not onely to helpe thoſe that, in great extremitie, come vnto them; but to enquire of thoſe that cannot come, and haue more neede: and leſt they ſhould faile in pittie, to goe to their houſes and ſee them: For when they goe thus with <hi>Moſes,</hi> to <hi>looke vpon their burthens, Exod.</hi> 2.11, by that ſtronger at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiue to pitty, (ſeeing) they cannot but be more moued
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4441:19"/>to be mercifull. And therefore S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh of viſiting the fatherleſſe and Widdowes in their aduerſitie, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.27. not onely of relieuing them when they come; but of ſeeing them, and ſeeing to them, when they cannot come: for he knew, and would haue vs to know, that to ſee the poore and ſicke in their pittifull houſes and neede, will more ſtirre a man in his bowells of mercy, then bare hearing can. And indeede it muſt needes be more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and more worke vpon vs, when wee ſee our owne wretched condition in their chaine: that is, that which God might haue layde vpon vs, and hath tranſlated to them, then if it were but reported to vs: for wee may doubt of the report; but neede not when wee haue ſeene: alſo, they may ſpeake of leſſe; but we ſhall know all when we ſee it our ſelues. And, and we are bound in the chaine of a commaundement, thus to viſite the poore and ſicke, that is, with our owne eies to doe it, &amp; not in a borrowed fight, with others eyes, may further be proued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Reaſons.</hi> For, (firſt) it is made by Saint <hi>Iames</hi> a ſpeciall propertie of <hi>true Religion, Iam.</hi> 1.27. and, if a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall propertie of Religion, then they that doe otherwaies, are (improperly) religious.</p>
               <p>Secondly, were are naturally vnmercifull, and except we ſee, wee will not beleeue: therefore for this cure of our hard hearts, it is needfull to goe home to the poore, bound with fetters of ſickneſſe to their beddes or houſes, that we may ſee with our owne eyes, and not darkly, as through Spectacles, by thoſe whom we ſend.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this dutie vnperformed, they may dye for want, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> at the <hi>rich mans</hi> gate: and if they doe their bloud will be required at the Pariſh hands, which, for not looking better to them, haue ſhed it. I tell you, the King will be anſwered for a Subiect: and God will not loſe a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, without this, we are ſtrangers to our brothers loue: and if we be; and ſo, or by being ſo, ſhut vp, to wit, in an vncharitable hardneſſe, our compaſſions from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4441:20"/>him, by not comming to him, <hi>how can the loue of God be in vs,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn?</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p>Not ſufficient therefore to giue at our doores; but we muſt enquire, or hearken after ſuch as are in want; ſpecially poore and ſicke-houſe keepers, chiefely thoſe of the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of faith: and hearing of them, we muſt ſend vnto them according to our ſtore. For loue is painefull, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in a pennie-almes, but is <hi>rich in good workes,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. Charitie bindeth vs that are Chriſtians, to more then to the giuing of a pennie by the way, or of a peece of bread to beggars at our doore. For our Sauiour Chriſt, charging the vnmercifull on his left hand, that they had neglected to doe good where they owed it, to wit to his poore; ſpeaketh of more then of feeding the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, or of giuing them a cup of drinke. For he ſaith further: <hi>I was naked and yee clothed me not, a stranger and yee lodged me not; ſicke and in priſon, and yee viſited me not, Math.</hi> 25.43. In which particulars, Chriſts meaning is to ſhewe that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is to be exerciſed in all theſe, and that the doing of one of them, or of two, excuſeth not a Chriſtian. Therefore ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Iob</hi> did not onely not ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e his morſells alone, but made the <hi>poore to drinke of his fountaines, and warmed the naked with his fleece,</hi> and <hi>receiued home vnto him the wandring ſtranger.</hi> This did <hi>Iob, the father of the poore;</hi> who well deſerued the name. And ſo ſhould all rich-chriſtians doe: and ſuch be, or may well be called, <hi>Fathers of the poore,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> was. For as a naturall father prouideth not onely bread for his child, but raiment, lodging, and other neceſſaries: ſo rich and able Chriſtians ſhould as fathers, not onely doe one but all of theſe duties to Gods poore, as to the children of God, and their brethren in him. All cannot doe all this, and ſome that haue the beſt minde, haue the feweſt meanes; yet let ſuch <hi>offer their two mites,</hi> the gift of their good will, and it will ſuffice. And now to moue the vnwilling to a worke of ſuch import, and ſo commanded; let them firſt conſider that the caſe of the pooreſt may (God knowes how ſoone) be made theirs. They are rich to day, they may be poore
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4441:20"/>to morrow: and who ſhall giue to them, who (when they were able) would <hi>giue to none? Prou.</hi> 21.13. May not their owne meaſure be returned? may they not iuſtly be ſerued with it? <hi>Math.</hi> 7.2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God in both Teſtaments requireth this duty vnder great penalties: if he had not, it is our debt to him, who giues vs all: and ſhould we not pay it?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we <hi>are members one of another:</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.26, and will one member ſee another periſh, and not ſuccour it? Or when we are full, ſhall we thinke no man is empty? When are in our warme houſe, that none is harbourleſſe? that no man is ſicke, when we are whole? and no man in trouble, when we are at reſt? And becauſe we haue abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that no man feeleth want? Shall nature teach one member to helpe another? and ſhall not grace, or the bond of grace, bind the <hi>members of Chriſt,</hi> one to relieue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the reward is great, for a <hi>cup of cold water the cup of glory, Math.</hi> 10.42. And ſhall we <hi>we not haue reſpect to the recompence of reward? Hebr.</hi> 11.26. To <hi>lend vnto men vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vſury is forbidden, Pſal.</hi> 15.5. but to lend ſo to God, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to <hi>his poore,</hi> is commanded, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.27. Of all vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, this is ſafeſt, and hath the richeſt returne.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we are but ſtewards, not owners of the goods we call ours; and they are matters of truſt from God, and not of priuate intereſt to thoſe that haue them. Now ſhall the ſteward turne into his owne profite, or bury in his owne pleaſures his Maiſters money, and not come to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it? The ſteward, that did ſo, (as we heard) was reckened with: <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.2, and ſuch vniuſt ſtewards ſhall be ſure to heare one day; <hi>Giue an account of thy ſtewardſhip, Luk ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, God giueth vs the example, who giueth abu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Should we not <hi>be mercifull, as our heauenly father is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull? Luk.</hi> 6.36. Nay, <hi>he that died for vs feeds vs,</hi> that is, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually <hi>feedes vs with his body,</hi> and will we not <hi>feede him</hi> with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4441:21"/>our meate? <hi>He clothes vs with his righteouſnes,</hi> and ſhall we thinke it much to <hi>cloth him</hi> with our caſt apparell? He hath prepared for vs in heauen; and will we doe nothing for him on earth? Now what we doe to poore Chriſtians, we doe to him: and what we doe to him, muſt be in more then in a peece of bread giuen him at our doores; we muſt lodge him, and clothe him, and doe other things vnto him: <hi>freely we haue receiued, freely we muſt giue, Math.</hi> 10.8. So much for this poore mans ſores; the effects, by which he is further deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, follow. The firſt is.</p>
               <q>Which was laid at his gate, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>In the greeke; <hi>Who was laid prostrate,</hi> or <hi>all along at</hi> the rich mans <hi>gate-houſe.</hi> It is like, he could neither ſtand nor ſit, he was ſo full of ſores. And where we reade of the rich mans gate-houſe; it may be gathered he had a large and ſtately houſe: a houſe of great receit, and many in houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his traine of ſeruants, and the company of dogges he kept. And though all theſe had houſe-roome ſufficient, and inough for the belly, yet a righteous poore man full of ſores and hunger, lying at his doore, could haue nothing. For (as followeth) though he deſired but crummes, he could not haue them. What can the rich man ſay to this? that he ſaw him not? He could not goe out of doores, but he muſt ſee him: for he lay at his gate. That he was able to worke? He was full of ſores, and could not. That he had no ſuch neede? wherefore then did he begge crummes, and not the whole bread of the rich mans table? That there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and he could not ſerue all? We reade but of one, euen <hi>Lazarus.</hi> That hee might haue gone to other houſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed him: the rich man fared well, and ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, euery day. This rich man (therefore) is without all
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4441:21"/>excuſe; as his dealing was without all mercy toward ſo poore a man. But where one ſo reſpected of God, is ſo humbled by him at a Churles gate,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> we learne that it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtrange, God ſhould beginne his viſitation at his owne houſe. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>The time is come, that it muſt beſo,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17, and Chriſt: <hi>Our friend Lazarus ſleepeth: Ioh.</hi> 11.11. That is, is already dead, <hi>v.</hi> 14. So when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers were ſent againſt Ieruſalem, their charge from God was, to beginne at home, <hi>at his owne Sanctuarie, Ezech.</hi> 9.6. And when the Lord would viſit the proud heart of the King of <hi>Aſhur</hi> with his deſtructions; he profeſſeth to doe all his worke, to wit, of viſitation <hi>vpon mount Sion and Ieruſalem, his owne citie and houſhold people firſt, Eſay</hi> 10.12. <hi>Ier.</hi> 25.12. The bitter <hi>cup of indignation,</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> was prepared for many Kings, and a large people and world of men; but who muſt drinke firſt? and to whom was this <hi>cup of deſolation</hi> by the ſword firſt ſent? Was it not to the <hi>cittie where his name was called vpon, Ier.</hi> 25.29. &amp; 49.52. Was not <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> plagued firſt, and many and great nations after her? So a poore man heere is ſore viſited, and the rich man ſpared till his turne come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The reaſons.</hi> He that is the Maiſter of a family, will haue an eye to his owne houſe before ſtrangers. So he that is the Lord of his people, will firſt looke to his owne houſhold people, and after to the ſtrange-children. He will firſt nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with correction his owne ſonnes and ſeruants; and then ſmite with deſtruction and plagues all that are forth of his houſe, being not ſonnes nor ſeruants, but enimies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it more iuſtifieth the Lord, when he will not ſpare ſinne at home; ſo neare him; and cannot but more ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the enimie when God ſhall viſit for his ſinne. For he hath leſſe to ſay againſt him when his owne haue not eſcaped.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God will not haue his children condemned with the world; therefore he will chaſten them, when hee ſpares the world, that is, ſinners in the world, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. He will pull them in betimes, and becauſe he lou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for theſe outward things of eaſe, credit, and a wealthy life, what are they but medicines for the diſeaſe of ſinne?

               <p>A ſecond proper effect concerning <hi>Lazarus;</hi> who (greatly) pinched with the croſſe of ponertie, and hauing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4441:23"/>deadly ſores vpon him, and a grieuous hunger, yet breakes not out by impatience, as our beggers would; but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly craueth ſome reliefe from the very crummes of the rich mans table. He craued not any varietie for a ſicke and weake ſtomacke, nor would chuſe his almes, as ſome that come to our doores now, who haue more neede of the Magiſtrates diſcipline then of that they aske: but begged onely ſome of the caſt bread, and (queſtionleſſe) would haue bin thankfull for it.</p>
               <p>By whoſe example our poore are taught to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their almes, whether of crummes, as <hi>Lazarus;</hi> or of gleaning, as <hi>Ruth. Ruth.</hi> 2.2.3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The reaſons.</hi> Men ſhould ſubmit to that eſtate that God hath laide vpon them; and being poore,<note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, if ſeruants muſt be contented with their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, (perhaps leſſe then they deſerue): much more beggers with the almes that is freely giuen.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the contrary were to walke ſtubbernly againſt God, and therefore to prouoke him to walke ſtubbernly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. For their pouerty is his chaſtiſement: and therefore, deſpiſing what God ſhall ſend by it, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the rod, and him that ſent it.</p>
               <p>A reproofe of our vnthankfull poore,<label type="milestone">

The <hi>poore ſhould ſpeake with prayers: Prou.</hi> 18.23, That is, ſubmiſſely, as they that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate: but now they ſpeake as the rich; not humbly with prayer, nor dutifully with thankes, but with proud and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent replyings. For they anſwer rowghly, and not with a gentle tongue, when they haue not what they would. Theſe are not caſt downe before the Lord: for then they would in better behauiour, caſt downe themſelues before men. Nay, but ſuch ſet themſelues rather to wreſtle with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4441:24"/>God, who will therefore bring ſeuen plagues more, and ſeuen times greater vpon them, till they be either humbled, or deſtroyed, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26.21.24. If their pouerty cannot humble them, nor their miſery make them ſtoupe; (where yet <hi>Pharao,</hi> and <hi>Haman,</hi> and <hi>Benhadad</hi> in their afflictions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came humble and ſtouped vnto thoſe who they knew, could helpe them); the Lord hath other meanes to make them perceiue who he is, either by plagues on earth, or by that plague of plagues, their iuſt damnation in hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lazarus</hi> here deſireth but to be fed with crummes, yet it doth not appeare by the text that any man gaue them to him; rather it is euident by that which followeth, that no man did.

How haue ſuch remembred euery day to looke for death? and euery houre to prepare to die? or rather how haue ſuch forgotten to eſteeme of euery day as of their laſt day? and to prepare for euery houre as for their dying houre?

               <p>Thus we haue heard that it is common both to rich and poore to die. Yet, in the order obſerued in the text, this poore godly man, he that was in ſuch miſery, pained with ſuch hunger died firſt. It was to haſten him to glory, and from the euils he endured here.</p>
               <p>And ſo we ſecondly learne,<note place="margin">Doctr. 2.</note> that the deaths of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are their gaine, or a ſpeedy taking of them from euils preſent, and to come. So ſaith <hi>Eſay,</hi> the righteous, that is, they that loue righteouſnes, and haue it imputed, <hi>are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> or gathered <hi>from the euill to come: Eſa.</hi> 57.1: That is,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4441:30"/>both from the euill of ſinne, and from the euils that come by ſinne: and this taking away is in their bodies for the graue, in their ſoules for glory. Thus was<note n="d" place="margin">2. King. 22, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioſuah taken away,</hi> a good King, and a good King, young.

And when the cheekes of the godly are blubbered with weeping for the euils they ſee, and euill things they ſuffer of the vnworthy world, God doth not delay, by taking them out of the world &amp; to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to wipe all ſuch <hi>teares of paine and crying from their eyes.

                  <hi>The reaſons.</hi> The Lord <hi>remembreth whereof they are made,</hi> and knoweth that (as duſt) they will quickly be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the wind of long troubles: and therefore will not contend for euer with them, that is, ouerlong, <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, the <hi>world is not worthy of ſuch. Hebr.</hi> 11.38. or, the righteous are a bleſſing that the world cares not for. Now, a bleſſing vnregarded, or vſed vnworthily, may (worthily) be taken away. Where therefore the wicked ſet ſo little by the righteous, God doth haſten to take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for their plague, and the euerlaſting good of his children.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; in this life the godly haue nothing but loſſe vpon loſſe: as the loſſe of their good labours, the loſſe of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4441:31"/>their good name, and the loſſe of their time here. Beſides, for their afflictions, their death onely makes an end of them; life and miſery being as two twins, that are borne together, and muſt die together. And is it not then the great aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the righteous, and their great preferment by death, that by it they are drawne out of ſo many and fatall euils, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bleſſed reſt and glory of God, in the which they ſhall continue euer? So long as they abide here in their tents of warre, they muſt not put off their harneſſe at any time: day and night they muſt lie in the field, expecting a battell, wherein is no time of truce. For if Satan be ouercome at one time, at another hee will ſet vpon them: onely death ends the battell, not to his auaile, but to theirs. They that die in thoſe battells are ouercome; in thoſe other the Saints neuer ouercome till they die: and is not their death then, their vndoubted aduantage and gaine that ſo die?</p>
               <p>But doth God take away the righteous ſpeedily and ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, becauſe the world is not worthy of them,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> as the wicked are vnworthy to liue in the world? Then, they that ſuruiue the righteous, haue iuſt cauſe to feare that for their vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe ſuch are taken from them; and becauſe they no better regarded them, nor Gods loue by them. Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice when a good man dies; not becauſe he is taken from labour to reſt, from death to life; but becauſe they hated him for his goodnes, and deſired rather his roome then his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany here: but let ſuch know that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Lot</hi> being departed out of <hi>Sodome, fire and brimſtone</hi> will come quickly after, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.17.23.24. For the wheate being gathered into the barne, what ſhall be done with the tares? ſhall they not (being bound vp for the fire) be ſet on a burning? <hi>Math.</hi> 13.30. When the godly <hi>Lazarus</hi> is dead, not long after dieth the vngodly <hi>Dines:</hi> but <hi>Lazarus</hi> is in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, and the rich man in hell in torments. Aſſoone as <hi>Noah</hi> is in the Arke, the world that mocked him, is in their graue of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and moſt of them in their center of fire. Therefore, when the righteous periſh, the wicked (behind them) haue great cauſe to howle and weepe, but no cauſe to laugh or
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4441:31"/>be merry, except this may make them glad; that making no good vſe of their happy ends, their owne vnhappy end is not farre off, that waiteth for them to damnation. Now, <hi>conſider this yee that forget God, leſt he teare you in peeces, and there be none to deliuer you. Pſal.</hi> 50.22. Let <hi>Lazarus,</hi> let the godly be regarded while they liue with you, leſt (for your contempt of ſuch) God take them to bliſſe, and ſend you to hel. Or if God remoue ſome yong, and in their tender bud, ſparing you in your threeſcore, and ſtubberne roote; know, that it is done of the Lord, either to bring you to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: or if you will not repent, to harden you further to deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Further, is the death of the righteous, the righteous mans gaine; Then let not the godly man feare to die,<label type="milestone">

That which is bitter to worldly men is pleaſure to him: that which is wofull to them, is ioy to him: that which bringeth them into miſery, draweth him out: and what takes him out of the priſon of life, caſts them into the priſon of hell. No maruell then if the wicked be loth to die: but great maruell that the godly ſhould feare to die. For, for the wicked, (ſpecially the rich, ſuch as this rich man); here they are well, and cannot hope that their remoue ſhall be to better, or ſo good: and therefore their change to a place they know not whither, and to a life, they know not what, muſt needes much trouble them: and no maruell, if they who know no better life, leaue this againſt their willes.</p>

But when death ſhall bee conſiderd with the aduantage, that is, as it is to the righteous, and as Chriſt hath taken from it the viſour of feare to them, and to all that loue his comming: the day of death, as the day of the Iewes deliuerance from <hi>Haman,</hi> cannot but be a feaſt day, and a good day. <hi>Eſt.</hi> 8.17. a day of deliuerance from the <hi>Haman</hi> of hell, from the power of ſinne, and powers of darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle conſidering this, deſired to bee gone: ſhall wee thinke in a deſperate moode, as they that care not which end goes forward? No, but he did it vpon good and iuſt grounds, knowing the happineſſe that wayted for him, and which waiteth for all that haue his thirſt to bee with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The feare of death is naturall: ſo children feare to goe in the darke: but the feare of it, for it ſelfe, is weake: For many times death paſſeth with leſſe paine then the torture of a limme. But the death to be feared, is the death that hath ſinne in it: and the reaſon of the feare, becauſe ſinne that brought it, is fearefull.</p>
               <p>Now the godly mans death is no ſuch death, hauing the teeth of ſinne pulled out of it, that it cannot bite; his death is but his ſleepe in his bed, and reſt from his labours: and therefore to him to dye, is no more then to goe to his reſt at night; or hauing eſcaped the ſea, to come to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen where he would bee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.30. And who would feare ſo to doe? But their beſt preferment is, where (here) they are abſent from Chriſt, there they ſhall euer be with him: where (here) they pleaſe God weakely, and offend
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4441:32"/>him daily; there they ſhall both pleaſe him, and enioy pleaſures with him for euer: and where (here) they are ſtrangers, there they ſhall be at home in their owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and proper ayre, with the whole bleſſed Trinitie, the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>So much for that which is common to the rich man &amp; <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and for their different eſtates on earth: their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent eſtates after they left the earth follow.</p>
               <q>And was carried by the Angels into Abrahams boſome.</q>
               <p>The difference that was betweene the rich man and <hi>Lazarus</hi> after their death, was greater then (before) in their life here: for <hi>Lazarus</hi> went to heauen; It is ſayde that the Angels carried him, as in their hands thither. The other went to hell; It is ſayde, hee was in torments in hell. Here hee that could not bee brought by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in the rich mans houſe into the wicked rich mans kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen, is carried by the angels (which for that purpoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the godly at their death) into the boſome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, into the glorious heauen of Gods preſence, where <hi>Abraham</hi> is, and whither all <hi>Abrahams</hi> children come. Hee that could haue but the dogges here to beare him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, hath now the welcom company of the Angels to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him. Hee whom no man regarded, the Angels now honour: And he now feedeth on the tree of life, that could not haue the offals of the Rich mans table to feede on. Is not this a great change? But ſuch honour had he; <hi>and ſuch honour haue all Gods Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, in theſe words, and in <hi>Lazarus,</hi> two things may bee conſidered; as, by whom he was carried, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He was carried by the Angels (ſayth the Text) that is, by thoſe ſpirituall, heauenly, and moſt excellent ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that miniſter before the glory of God continually: for theſe glorious ſpirits, Gods good Angels, and thoſe flames of fire his Miniſters doe, by diuine commandement, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to the heyres of ſaluation; diuerſly whiles they liue,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4441:33"/>and ſweetely at their death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14.</p>
               <p>The place whither <hi>Lazarus</hi> was carried, is Heauen; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a kind of <hi>Periphraſis,</hi> or kind of ſpeech, <hi>Abrahams boſome,</hi> or the bay of reſt from all ſtormes below.</p>
               <p>And ſo wee ſee that the glory of the godly begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in their death, as the glory of the wicked endes in theirs.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the Angels; and in briefe, to tell you what they are, as the word telles mee; they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances created without bodies: the time when, was within the 6. dayes, the place where, was in heauen. Of theſe an innumerable company fell quickly, and together, (for as they were made within the 6. dayes, ſo within that time they fell; and theſe we call (now) Diuels; that is, Angels by their creation, but diuels by their fal, for which they are <hi>Chained vp in vtter darknes,</hi> Iude. 6. The other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which (alſo) are innumerable, ſtood, and euer ſhall ſtand by grace in the puritie and righteouſneſſe, wherein their <hi>Makers</hi> hand (at firſt) ſet them</p>
               <p>And theſe are the Angels that this Scripture ſpeaketh of, which are called Angels for their ſeruice and miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for in their ſubſtance they are ſpirites, and in their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <hi>Angels,</hi> Pſal. 103.20. &amp; 104.4. And Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they miniſter to the righteous in their life; and at the end of their life, as here to <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where wee learne; that the good Angels are, by Gods ordinance,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> euer about the righteous; that is, about their paths in their life, and at their beds in their death, to doe ſeruice to them.</p>
               <p>Thus three Angels came to <hi>Abraham, Gen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4441:33"/>but ſixety times ſixe <hi>Pitch about the righteous,</hi> Pſal. 34.7. In the olde Teſtament, there is a cloud of ſuch proofes, and good ſtore of them in the new. So true it is, and ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the Angels haue a charge from God to keepe the righteous in all their wayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11. That is, in all their righteous wayes to attend them. <hi>The little ones haue their Angels,</hi> Math. 18.10. Both little ones in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie, and little ones in yeares: the Angels are theyr Rockers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The reaſons.</hi> Chriſtians are a royall Prieſthood, that is, ſpiritually, Prieſts and Princes, And Princes muſt haue their guard, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. Worldly Princes haue their guard at Court; and Chriſtians that are Princes, haue Angells for their guard in the Court of the Church, where they ſerue day and night.</p>
               <p>Secondly, innumerable euill Angels are about vs, and dangers hang ouer vs: and therefore if the good Angels did not watch ouer vs, and tarry with vs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the bad; If their ſhield were not before vs to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs, and their perſons at our backe to ſaue vs, when dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are neere; how is it poſſible in ſo great malice of the enemie, and multitude of daungers, for Gods little ones to be in ſafety? I ſay not but God can ſaue without them; but I ſpeake of <hi>His ordinary way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in this ſenſe; If the good Angels did not keepe vs, how ſoone would the euill that beare vs ſuch hatred, teare vs in peeces, and deuoure vs? How could our little Children euer liue to be men in ſo many caſualties of a childes life, if theſe bleſſed Spirites did not day &amp; night keepe them, and euery part in them, and euery bone in them? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.20.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the righteous are members of that head, which the <hi>Angels worſhip,</hi> Heb. 1, 6. and honouring the head, how can they but ſerue the body? or doing the one by Gods commandement, how can they but doe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by it? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91, 11.</p>

               <p>An inſtruction to Chriſtians not to carry themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerently at any time in their words or wayes, becauſe of the Angels. So the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> would not haue <hi>women vncouered in the aſſembly,</hi> becauſe of them. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10. If a noble man were in place, would we vnciuilly carry our ſelues: and ſhall we forget our holy calling in the worthy preſence of the Angels: ſhall we make their waiting vpon vs tedious vnto them, by behauing our ſelues otherwaies in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4441:35"/>their ſight, then beſeemeth their high perſons, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable birth of a Chriſtian. And now, that we are (all of vs) before God in the Miniſtery and at prayer; let vs ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally take heede how we demeane our ſelues; leſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that grace our aſſemblies with their preſence, when they returne to heauen, complaine of our vnchriſtian inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilitie in this holy place. As if they ſhould ſay to God: we were in ſuch an aſſembly, profeſſing thy name and worſhip, but whiles thou waſt ſpeaking to them by thy word and Miniſter, ſome were talking, ſome girding at the Preacher, ſome laughing and fleering, ſome making gaudes and mouthes, ſome flat along, not in prayer, but in a ſlouenly rudeneſſe, perhaps in their drouſie drunkenneſſe; and ſome were faſt aſleepe.</p>
               <p>Is this a good report? and ſhould we not dread to be thus ſpoken of to God? Further, let them conſider this, who when they are priuate, care not what they ſay or doe; and what ſteames they ſend vp of a corrupt and vnſauory dunghill within, in all their talke to their priuate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, without any grace to the hearers. Such forget that the Angels are neare, who want not eares, as they be full of eyes; that is, are not ſlowe to heare, as they be quicke to ſee: and how can they then be hidden? This is to grieue the Angels, and to make the God of Angels to grieue them. So farre for the perſons that caried the ſoule of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the place followeth, to which they caried it.</p>
               <q>Into Abrahams boſome.</q>
               <p>The place of comfort to which the Angels brought the ſoule of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> is here called <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome by a trope or figure: becauſe, as the fathers boſome is the place of the childes reſt: ſo heauen is that boſome of eternall reſt, into which <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father-beleeuer, with all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of promiſe which are beleeuers, are receiued, in their ſoules, till the day of the reſurrection. And it is no other but the bay or hauen of repoſe from all ſtormes mortall;

What ſhall I further ſay? this already ſpoken is ſufficient to cleare this Scripture, from ſending the ſoule of <hi>Lazarus</hi> to hell, or to any part of hell: and therfore <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome in this text is no other then heauen, the ſeate of God, and of the bleſſed Saints in light; an harbour of reſt from the waues and Sea of this troubleſome world: &amp; vnto it is the ſoule of <hi>Lazarus</hi> brought preſently after his death: from whence learne, that after this life of paine and labour, there is nothing but ioy and peace to the righteous, ſo ſaith <hi>Eſay:</hi> He, that is, the righteous perſon, of whom he ſpake in the former verſe, ſhall enter into peace, that is, preſently after his death, enter, or <hi>make his entry vpon it, Eſa.</hi> 57.2. God reckened with thoſe in their death, who had receiued their Lords money. The account came not till they died: and therefore ſaith the text, When the <hi>Maiſter of thoſe ſeruants returned,</hi> (who is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4441:36"/>ſaid to returne, when <hi>duſt returneth to the earth as it was, and the ſpirit to God that gaue it, Eccleſ.</hi> 7,) he ſaid to the good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant and faithfull; <hi>Enter into thy Maiſters ioy, Math.</hi> 25.21.23. That is, into ioyes vnſpeakeable and glorious, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8, or, ſuch as the Maiſter hath prepared for all his faithfull ſeruants, after they haue ſerued their courſe and time here. He ſaith not, enter firſt into the fire of paine, and when that hath well purged thee, I will take thee to ioy: But without any more adoe, receiue that ioy, whereof as the fountaine had no beginning, ſo the riuers that come from it, ſhall haue no end. Receiue thy Maiſters ioy in that, and in theſe. So that there is no pauſe or ſtay made by the Lord at the deaths of the godly, but preſently they paſſe from death to life; not painfull, but truly ioyous and full of pleaſures for euer. The voice from heauen ſaid the ſame, and the Spirit ſealed to it; for ſo ſaith the Spirit, that is ſpeaketh ſo, and no otherwaies then the voice ſpake: which is; <hi>Bleſſed are the dead in the Lord,</hi> that is, the godly dead: and the reaſon is, they, to wit immediately after ſuch a death, <hi>rest from their labours;</hi> Apoc. 14.13: not in the purgatory of Papiſts where is no reſt, but in the paradiſe of God where is true ioy, and the plentifull redemption of the Saints. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thoſe that ſleepe in Ieſus, God will bring with him,</hi> 1. Theſ. 4.14. His mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning can be no other, but that aſſoone as they ſleepe in Chriſt, or die in him; God hath them preſently in his hand and keeping: who will keepe them till the time come that he hath appointed to deliuer them vp, &amp; to teſtifie who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath receiued. Thus it is plaine that the godly enter vpon happines preſently, &amp; ſo ſoone as they goe henceby death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The reaſons.</hi> The <hi>voice from heauen ſaith ſo,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſaith the Spirit,</hi> Apoc. 14.13.

But theſe two from heauen are more, and more ſure then a thouſand on earth: and therefore what they ſay is ſure, and muſt ſtand.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how ſhall the day of death be better to the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4441:36"/>righteous, then the day in which they are borne (as the Scripture ſpeaketh); if they who goe hence, come not out of paines but exchange them? nor end their miſery, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it? nor be in happines, but be troubled ſtill? <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 7.3.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſpeech of <hi>Abraham</hi> to the rich man muſt needes be true, which is, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> (now dead) is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,</hi> Luk. 16.25.

For the particularities of this place, and for the ſundry kindes and meaſures of glory therein, I liſt not to bee

               <p>Further, for the happineſſe of the ſoule after death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the body come vnto it at the reſurrection, the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it muſt needes bee great, ſeeing it ſhall ceaſſe to ſinne, and ſhall bee wholly ioyned to the Lord in truth, and neuer diſpleaſe him any more.

               <p>And for the body, when it is come to the ſoule at the Reſurrection; what a comfortable meeting will that bee of two ſuch friends and louers, ſo long kept aſunder? How will the ſoule welcome her companion and yoke-fellow in the croſſes and tempeſts of this life? How louingly will they enter together into their <hi>Maſters ioy?</hi> Where before it was full of ſores, ſickneſſe and paine: now it ſhall be a ſound body for euer; in which ſhall bee neither ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe nor paine hereafter. It did hunger and thirſt, it ſhal neuer hunger and thirſt any more. It was a mortall body, now it ſhall neuer dye againe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44.

Finally, both body, and ſoule in louing armes together, ſhall reigne with Chriſt for euer. They ſhal walke in the path of life, their glory ſhal be greater in the pleaſures of the Lord, then we can coceiue, or mans tong vtter. And therfore as it was ſaid at the crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Salomon,</hi> that the <hi>people ſo reioyced,</hi> that is, with ſuch
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4441:38"/>an exceeding <hi>great ioy, that the earth rang againe:</hi> 1. King. 1.40: So, how can any pleaſures be wanting, where the true <hi>Salomon</hi> and his royall Spouſe ſhall both be crowned together with glory in the Kingdome of Heauen? <hi>Such honour haue the Saints;</hi> and therefore great without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is their preferment euery way, and ſo much greater, becauſe preſently at their death, they receyue in their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoules but the moyty of that happy eſtate, which they are ſure to haue whole and full at the reſurrection.</p>
               <p>This doctrine is wickedly croſſed by the Papiſts in their Article of the ſoules paſsing to the paines of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory preſently after death:<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> ſpecially where they make the paines there, and burning therein as intollerable and great as thoſe paines, and that burning, which is in the helles of the damned, ſaue that there is a comming out of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, but no redemption in hell.</p>
               <p>But how are the godly comforted (as <hi>Lazarus</hi> here) at their death, when after their death they are thus tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? and where they thus labour in Purgatory, how can they bee ſayde to reſt from their labours? Did the theefe that went to Paradiſe goe to Purgatory? <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.43. or did Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who deſired to bee with Chriſt, deſire to bee with him in Purgatory? <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.23.</p>
               <p>Indeede to be with Chriſt (as the Apoſtle there ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) is beſt of all. And though it be not poſsible, as one ſayth, eyther to finde Chriſt in hell, or to miſſe him in heauen; yet a Chriſtian ſhould bee of the mind to deſire rather to bee in hell with Chriſt, then in heauen without him? But ſhall wee thinke that the Apoſtle was ignoraunt where Chriſt was, when he ſo earneſtly deſired his diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to be with him? And if hee knew, as no doubt but hee did, that hee was in heauen: then there is as little doubt, but his deſire was, at his death, to bee in heauen with him.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, that the caſe of theſe two was extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as being the caſe of two Martyres, who therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently went to heauen: It may be anſwered for the theefe,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4441:39"/>that his death was not a Martyrs death, though his ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was extraordinary: for the Papiſts owne doctrine is, that they who ſuffer as Martyrs, muſt ſuffer as voluntaries for Chriſt, and with intent of making ſatisfaction to God by ſuch martyrdome: but the theeues puniſhment was for himſelfe onely againſt his will, and without that ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind that is required in a Martyr, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.41.</p>
               <p>And if any had neede to goe to Purgatory for the end that the Papiſts ſend their dead thither: why not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted theefe, ſeeing hee had ſo ſhort a time to purge in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his conuerſion? But for Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> though hee were a Martyr for Chriſt, yet where doth it appeare, when hee ſpake theſe words: <hi>I deſire to bee looſed to bee with Chriſt:</hi> that he knew hee ſhould ſo ſuffer for him?</p>
               <p>Indeede it was propheſied that hee ſhould bee bound a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for him, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.11. It was alſo ſayde in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms, <hi>That bands and afflictions did abide him in euery city,</hi> Act. 20.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. But it cannot bee ſhewed that he then knew certainely that by <hi>Death he ſhould glorifie God</hi> as a Martyr. True it is, that hee was ready not to be bound onely, but to dye at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for the name of the Lord Ieſus, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.13: Yet how doth it appeare that he was certaine he ſhould die for it there, or otherwhere? But why ſhould Martyrs bee exempt more then other Saints from Purgatory? It ſeemes that this Apoſtle of the Gentiles, (though a Martyr) did not exempt himſelfe from the common eſtate of all the bleſſed after death: for when hee had ſpoken of ſuch afflictions as the Elect ſuffer here, &amp; of the glory to come: hee immediatly ſpeaking in the plural of all Saints, addeth, <hi>Wee know that when our earthly houſe is destroyed, wee haue a building giuen vs of God,</hi> 2. Cor. 5.1. As if hee ſhould haue ſayde, So ſoone as wee lay downe the one, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue the other; ſo ſoone as wee remoue from the body, wee dwell with the Lord, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. and ſo ſoone as we put off corruption, wee put on glory.</p>
               <p>This is the common fauour of the Elect, and not the particular priuiledge of one more then of another. So
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4441:39"/>Purgatory prayers are put out of office, and Purgatory fire is proued iniurious to the peaceable deaths of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly departed in the faith of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thur farre for the eſtate of <hi>Lazarus</hi> after his death, the contrary eſtate of the Rich-man after his death fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth</p>
               <q>The Rich man alſo dyed, and was buried.</q>
               <p>Wee before noted, that death is the common roade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of rich and poore: for <hi>Lazarus</hi> dyed, and the rich man alſo dyed. That, that followeth after his death is the next thing to be conſidered. And this concerneth him in his body or ſoule. That which concerneth him in his body is <hi>That it was buried;</hi> I doubt not but ſolemnely, and in great pompe. The old Tranſlator ſayth, <hi>Hee was buried in Hell,</hi> as it were in his owne Pariſh: but we reade no ſuch thing in the originall Greeke: It ſayth onely, <hi>He was buried.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lazarus</hi> (belike) was not; or not with ſuch a traine of followers, becauſe he was poore; therefore his Buriall is not ſpoken of. Which therefore doth not condemne the buriall of the dead, but their ſinfull partiality, who follow the rich (though wicked) to their graues, and neglect the poore (though godly) to honeſt their buriall.</p>
               <p>The duety of reuerend buriall is a neceſſary Chriſtian duty, and it is not reproued here; ſaue that it was a good duty ill done, and to a perſon vnworthy, and vainely done.</p>

Which, what is it but to pierce (though not Chriſt himſelfe, yet) the faithfull in Chriſt with the ſpeare of a ſecond death, <hi>after death?</hi> Ioh. 19.34. That is, after one death, to put them to another. Our following of them to their graues is the teſtimony of our loue; by it we witneſſe how we affected them aliue: and loue (if it be ſound loue, and without guile) will goe as farre as it can.

Yea many die, and becauſe we heare no more of them but that they be dead, we neither regard how they died, nor what is like to come of them, dying without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Therefore this terrible example is left as a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to vs, in time to conſider what followeth after death: and that is, a life after this life, either in ioy vnſpeakable, or in torments endleſſe. For with the laſt breathe in our bodies, we goe preſently in our ſoules to heauen or hell: good men to heauen, bad men to hell, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.27. Though men liue as beaſts, yet they ſhall not die as beaſts: that is, if they liue wickedly and die in ſinne, the beaſts death ſhall be farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then theirs. For, they in their death end their miſery; thoſe in death, doe but beginne theirs, that ſhall haue no end.</p>
               <p>But to come to the words themſelues, it is ſaid, that the rich mans ſoule was in hell in torments: and here is ſhewed wither his ſoule went, to wit, to hell; and what followed there. For the firſt: hell, or the place of hell is here deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by thoſe paines of ſenſe which are in it: and they are called hell torments. For hell is not onely a place of cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as priſons here; but of cuſtody and torment: therefore, is this rich man ſaid to be in hell in torments. He that dwelt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4441:41"/>in a ſtately pallace while he liued, now dead, dwelleth in an inglorious place of torments. He that had braue fellowes for his companions, hath for companions now, the diuell and his Angels: He that fed delicately, is now fed with fire and brimſtone. He that had his pleaſure here, is now tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented: and he is ſaid to be tormented in hell; both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the extremitie of torment, and eternitie of terme there. Which teacheth that there is no eaſe in hell,<note place="margin">Doct. 1. The fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This is the doctrine; and this doctrine is a roote of two branches: The firſt, that there is an extremitie of torments in hell; The ſecond, that theſe torments in hell are endleſſe. For the extremitie of the torments, it is expreſſed in the Scriptures, by things moſt dreadfull, and terrible out of meaſure; as <hi>vnquenchable fire; Math.</hi> 3.12: <hi>a lake of fire, burning with brimſtone:</hi> Apoc. 19.20: and a <hi>lake of fire and brimſtone,</hi> Apoc. 20.10. Of all torments none is ſo extreame as by fire: for fire, and all deſtruction by fire, is terrible. But it is more, and moſt terrible euer to flote vpon a riuer of fire; nay, euer to be ouer head and eares in a burning lake of fire and brimſtone. Terrible needes muſt this be, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> any thing in the world be terrible. Therefore, <hi>Eſay</hi> crieth out: <hi>Who can dwell with the deuouring fire? who can dwell with the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burning?</hi> Eſa. 33.14. As if he had ſaid, no man can. And yet the damned (whom God will throwe into it) ſhall by the power of his iuſtice be ſtrengthened for their greater increaſe of torments vnſpeakeable, to be in it, and to burne in it world without end.</p>
               <p>Further, and for further terrour, it is called <hi>vtter darkneſſe:</hi> Math. 22.13: where is fire, yea a whole lake of it, and no light: or a darke land couered with deadly obſcuritie, where the light that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1.22. It were terrible to be in a dungeon of darknes for a ſhort time: how terrible then, to be in this hell of darkneſſe for euer? They that loue darknes more then light, ſhall haue inough of it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4441:42"/>here, and paſſe from affected darknes to vtter darknes, from one darknes to another. We reade of torments inuented by men, and of cruell ones indeede, inflicted by heathen-men vpon Chriſtians: as fornaces of fire, caldrons of boiling oile, braſen Bulles, and that <hi>Moloch</hi> in the valley of <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom,</hi> where <hi>Idolators burnt their children to the dwell:</hi> 1. King. 11.7. But hell is larger then ſo, and the thing exceedes <hi>all report.</hi> 1. King. 10.7. <hi>Nebuchadnezars fornace was heated ſeuen times:</hi> Dan. 3.19: this more then ſeuenty times ſeuen. To be ſhut vp in the belly of a braſen Bull ouer a ſmall fire; and there to be till the heate kill him, muſt needes be a lingring and terrible death: but hell is much worſe, and without end. Therfore doth the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> compare <hi>hell to Tophet:</hi> Eſa 30.33: and <hi>Mathew,</hi> ſpeaking of it, calles it <hi>Gehenna,</hi> Math. 5.22, That is <hi>Tophet:</hi> becauſe of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ſcreakings of children, ſacrificed in that fire: but the ſcreakings of young and old in the <hi>Tophet</hi> of hell, the fire and burning there, is both intollerable and eternall.</p>
               <p>Thus hell torments muſt needes be great in reſpect of the extremitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The reaſons.</hi> The greater ſufferings, the greater torment. The ſufferings ſpoken of are exceeding great, and yet farre leſſe then any of thoſe that are prepared for the damned in the <hi>Tophet</hi> of hell. For theſe earthly may be expreſſed and conceiued, thoſe in hell cannot?</p>
               <p>Secondly, the wrath of God ſhall then be executed to the full againſt ſinners and vpon ſinne, which is executed more fauourably here, and with ſome mixture of clemencie. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, the diuels are in place and put in office to further the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction in that lake of torments.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if thoſe torments that afflict the body onely, be ſo great and intollerable, how great and intollerable muſt they be that ſhall afflict both ſoule and body in hell? The torments of hell are vniuerſall in all the parts of the body, and tender powers of the minde together: all at once ſhall be tormented.</p>
               <p>The paines of this life are (for the moſt part) particular,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4441:42"/>in ſome part of the body, or in ſome facultie of the ſoule: and yet how extreame they ſometimes proue to be, and how inſufferable, they that feele them can tell. The tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache is but the griefe of one part, perhaps but of one tooth; and yet ſome hauing it in ſome extremitie, haue wiſhed themſelues out of the world: the like of the ſtone, ſtrangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the like. What then, when euery part ſhall be rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and euery facultie tormented? and when they ſhall crie out in hell with this rich man, <hi>O, I am tormented in this flame?</hi> Luk. 16.24.

               <p>This Rich man in hell, and infinite thouſands in hell as rich as he while they liued, can ſay as much now.

               <p>It is ſaid hee lift vp his eyes; the more to increaſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of that he could not haue, and ſorrow for being deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.

But as in his life time, he turned his eyes from <hi>Lazarus,</hi> ſo now at his death, God turned his face from him: and ſo he ſawe, what he was not better, but worſe for ſeeing.

               <p>Thus he ſawe too late, and with late repentance at his

               <p>The rich man in the Goſpel, who promiſed to himſelfe a life of many yeeres, had not the poore life of one night to prepare for death, which tooke him away in his <hi>couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> Luk. 12.19.20.

When the old world thought leaſt of a change, the flood of death <hi>came,</hi> Luk. 17.27. And <hi>Sodome</hi> with her Cities thought leaſt of death, when her end came ſuddenly by <hi>fire from heauen.</hi> v. 29.</p>
               <p>As therefore the diuels ſaid to Chriſt, ſo are the wicked driuen to ſay to death: <hi>Art thou come to torment vs before our time?</hi> Math. 8.29.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4441:50"/>did <hi>Abraham:</hi> and yet in Hell, who muſt be his father, but father <hi>Abraham,</hi> whoſe ſonne in obedience hee would not be? but all this auayled him nothing; ſince they onely are <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, who doe the workes of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>

That is, ye that call your ſelues Chriſtians, and doe not like Chriſtians; to hell with yee.

Now, they that haue no more in them then the Iſrael of an outward profeſſion, or the baptiſme of water, howſoeuer (iudging as men) we cannot denie them the name and account of Chriſtians; yet when hee commeth to ſee his gheſts (who is of pure eyes, and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth otherwaies then man doth) hee will turne them out as intruders: command them to be taken away, to wit, from all communion with him, his bleſſed Angels, and glorified Saints: and ſend them to their owne place, where is weeping with gnaſhing of teeth, that is, ſorrow and griefe mingled with deſperation, <hi>Math.</hi> 22.13. <hi>This is the portion of their cup.</hi>

               <p>And therefore though we be admitted by the Miniſter, and allowed by men to goe for Chriſtians; yet, if we be not Chriſtians in life, and in the teſtimonie of our owne conſciences ſo, their teſtimonie will little? uaile vs againſt Gods examination, and the witneſſe of our owne hearts.

Let vs therefore approue our ſelues to God and our owne conſciences, by true repentance, truly and indeede to be Chriſtians. If we haue not repented thus, let vs now beginne: and if we haue, let vs doe it more.

For to receiue the ſeales of the couenant without the writing, and when we haue no promiſe from God in our ſinfull courſes, what is it but to take that which is none of ours, and with great ſinne, ſteale Gods ſeales and prints, which we muſt bring backe againe with ſhame, when he that ſtrictly obſerueth all mens wayes, ſhall ſay: <hi>Depart from me, yee workers of intquitie; I know you not?</hi> Luk. 13.27.

               <p>The matter of this rich mans requeſt is, generally for mercy; and more ſpecially, wherein he deſireth <hi>Abraham,</hi> to ſhew him mercy. As that he would be ſo good to him, as to ſend <hi>Lazarus, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the mercy which he craued, is here limited to the ſending downe of <hi>Lazarus</hi> to him, with a very ſmall quantitie of water to coole his tongue, tormented in a flame of fire that neuer goeth out. But yet, by <hi>Abrahams</hi> anſwere, in the next verſe, it appeareth that he failed euen of ſo ſmall a drop of mercy; becauſe while he liued, he would ſhewe no mercy to <hi>Lazarus</hi> at his gate.</p>

               <p>If men would conſider this, I meane cruell men and hard harted; or, if they would beleeue what is written, and thinke what may come, they would bee much more, both tender-hearted, and open-handed, then now they bee, laying vp mercy in the ſure cuſtody of a mercifull heart.

               <p>Let no man therefore, though neuer ſo great, thinke but hee may haue neede of a meaner then himſelfe before hee dye. <hi>The Reaſons.</hi> All Chriſtians are fellow, members in the Chriſtian body. Now in the naturall body, the head

And thou that feeſt a poore man (though a good man) and deſpiſeſt him, remember that God can (and perhaps will) make thee as he is, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of pouerty, and ſo thy contempt of thy brother may come home to thy ſelfe. <hi>Adonibezck</hi> the tyrant could ſay: <hi>As I haue done, ſo it is done to me,</hi> Iudg. 1.7.

               <p>In this ſort replyed <hi>Abraham</hi> in this verſe; where firſt hee cals him ſonne: which is not to iuſtifie, but more to condemn him: for, as he called him father in no obedience, ſo now he cals him ſonne with no comfort. Hee called him father, and would not doe as a ſonne: and now hee calleth him ſonne, and will not bee as a father to him.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4441:59"/>theſe, and all ſuch as theſe, will one day remember vs, or bee remembred to vs, though we would forget them; there is a Table of remembrance kept, and a booke of <hi>Items,</hi> which will bee found in all conſciences that are not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before they goe hence; for, conſcience followeth ſinne as hell doth death; and then they ſhall heare of all, that here would not endure to bee told of any: nothing ſhall then bee concealed, where here nothing muſt bee knowne.

               <q>That thou in thy life time receyuedſt thy pleaſures, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>The matter of <hi>Abrahams</hi> reply by deniall ſtandeth in two things, which made the Rich mans requeſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be granted. The firſt, in this verſe; the ſecond in the next. The firſt is, becauſe hee had his heauen of pleaſures here, which ended with his end in death. The ſecond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had inuiolably ſhut vp the way, as with an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting barre, between heauen and hell. The firſt is taken from the iuſtice of God, which requiteth thoſe with pains, who for their pleaſures here, put his poore (as <hi>Diues</hi> this poore man) to paine. The ſecond is taken from his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance eternall; which is, that there ſhall neuer bee any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe out of hell, or paſſage and path-way betweene heauen and bell; and this in the next verſe. The firſt thing in this firſt reaſon of denial, is taken from the contraries of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and paine here: where, by pleaſures we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, not lawfull pleaſures, but the pleaſures of ſinne: and by paine, the paines of pouerty and hunger in godly <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> not relieued, nor any way pittied by mercileſſe <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.</hi> For ſimply, this Rich man could not be condemned, becauſe he had pleaſures here, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> paine: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he altogether here followed his pleaſures, and would not with his crummes eaſe this poore mans paine: as if

               <p>This was <hi>Abrahams</hi> meaning, and therefore it condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not the Rich man, that he was wealthy, and had ſome pleaſures here: but becauſe hee was rich and cruell, and becauſe drunken with the pleaſures of life, becauſe his minde was altogether ſet vpon worldly vanities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in euill workes; and neuer a whit vpon heauenly things, and no time vpon goodneſſe. We heard before that riches co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in themſelues and not abuſed by their owners, doe not bolt the doore of heauen againſt any, as neyther do the pleaſures of life, vſed lawfully and well: for then, no Rich-man could bee ſaued, nor any that liueth in any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures here: but<note n="b" place="margin">Auguſtine</note> poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> is in rich <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and godlineſſe hath the promiſes of this life, and of that which is to come, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. And as riches, and pleaſures doe not in themſelues barre any out of heauen; ſo neyther doe pouerty and paine for themſelues, bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thither: for <hi>Lazarus</hi> was not ſaued, becauſe hee was poore, and in paine: but becauſe in theſe, hee truſted in God, and waited for his ſaluation.</p>
               <p>To winde vp, and to come to the point: That which condemned this Rich man, was the abuſe, as hath beene ſayde, of his wealth and pleaſures heere, and becauſe the ſoule of his delight was in them, not delighting in God, &amp; hating his poore.</p>
               <p>From whence we learne,<note place="margin">Doct. 1</note> that they who heere are drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in pleaſures, and in the loue of their belly, muſt heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after looke to liue in paine and miſery, as this Rich man in the torments of hell for ever. So it is threatned to the young man, who cheared himſelfe with the joy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of youth, following euery pleaſure, and pleaſant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, that his heart could imagine, or eye ſee, that for all theſe things, he ſhould bee brought to iudgemen, to witte,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4441:60"/>to the iudgement of condemnation, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.9. Alſo when ſpirituall <hi>Babylon</hi> was fallea, the doome ſhee recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for her life of pleaſures was, So much as ſhee liued in pleaſures, ſo much giue yee to her of torment and ſorrow, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18.7, that is, weight for weight: or as ſhee could make no end of her pleaſures, ſo let her haue no end of her ſorrowes, and put her deepe in hell, as her ſoule was deepe ſunke in helliſh luſts. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the luſts of youth, bids men to flye from them, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22. not to goe foot-pace from them, as it that would ſerue; but to flye, as much as if he had ſaid, they will ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ouertake you to perdition, if you turne not ſpeedily as vnder wing, from them to the life of righteouſneſſe, with them that call on the Lord with a pure heart. <hi>Iob</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as much in effect, where hee confeſſeth that God might iuſtly haue rooted out his plants, if his heart had walked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his eye, <hi>Iob</hi> 31.7.8. I will not ſay how fitly, or vnfitly rather, this was ſpoken vnto, or of God by him concerning the counſels of the Almighty, which are alwayes iuſt: yet ſure it is, that that holy man was perſwaded that they iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerue a cutting off, who walke after their eyes heere, that is, after them in vanities: and that there is no hope for ſuch but in their ſound repentance. Looke not then if thou belong to Chriſt, for ioy and proſperity continually on earth; or to haue thy heauen here, and in another world: For it is a foule errour vnder the Sunne, and the dotage of thoſe fooles, who make this world their heauen, &amp; make heauen nothing. And if it bee true (as it is moſt ſure) that they who will follow Chriſt, muſt ſwimme after him in a ſea of burning glaſſe, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 15.2, that is, bee caſt as into a ſea, or follow him in a whole ſea of miſeries here: then to enio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and feele in this life (in ſoule and body) perpetual eaſe, pleaſure, and content, cannot but be an vnfit thing for a true Chriſtian, and heyre of a better life. The point therefore is plaine, that there is no hope of a better life, if wee haue our hope onely in this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The reaſons.</hi> How can we come through aduerſity to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4441:60"/>happineſſe, if wee ſuffer no troubles here? How can our teares be wiped away, when we haue ſhed none? how can we be like our head, if wee will bee crowned with roſe-buds, where he was crowned with thornes? and if wee doe not ſuffer with him, how can wee reigne with him? The Cattell that goes in the beſt paſture is for ſlaughter, where that that feedes on the bare Common is for ſtore: ſo they are for the Axe rather then for any continuance, who liue altogether at eaſe in the beſt paſtures of <hi>Sion;</hi> where they that are kept on the bares Commons of troubles for well doing, are the Lords owne ſtore.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a man drowned is paſt helpe: and what helpe for thoſe that are drowned in the pleaſures as it were a whole ſea of ſinne? Thirdly, here they ſayd to God, <hi>Depart from vs,</hi> Iob. 21.14: hereafter God will ſay to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Depart from mee yee workers of iniquitie.</hi> Here they ſerued their pleaſures, and had no pleaſure to ſerue God: heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after their pleaſures ſhall leaue them which they ſerued, &amp; God whom they would not ſerue, ſhall condemne them. Here they would not bee ſaued, and hereafter they ſhall not: for Chriſt will ſay to ſuch, as to <hi>Ieruſalem, I would, but yee would not,</hi> Math. 23.37. Fourthly, the tenour and order of Gods iuſtice is inuiolable. Now it is a ſpecial part of the glory of his iuſtice, as to ſhew forth his mercy on the righteous, ſo to execute his fierce wrath vpon vnrighteous perſons and ſinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6: therefore the widdow that liueth in pleaſures is ſay de to be dead while ſhe liueth, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. I conclude then, that the life of pleaſures is a dead life, or life of death: I meane, of ſecond death.</p>
               <p>And it is ſo that men cannot in the manner that this Rich man did liue here in pleaſures,<label type="milestone">

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4441:61"/>what good end can they make out of ſo bad beginnings? Let them conſider this, who take no pleaſure in the ſeruice of God, and take ſo much pleaſure in vanity; who vpon the Sabboth leaue the Communion of the Saints at Gods houſe, to haue communion with ſinners at Tauernes or in ſome Alehouſe: and who day after day, fill themſelues with wine and ſtrong drinke, and ſeeke not the Lord; as they haue done, ſo they meane to doe ſtill; to morrow, as to day, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 56.12.</p>
               <p>Let them alſo conſider who are ſo tender, and keepe themſelues ſo tenderly, that no winde may blow vpon them; the webbe of their life runs all in an euen thread, &amp; there is no knot in it concerning theſe outward things, or as it is in the Pſalme, <hi>They proſper alwayes, and increaſe in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> Pſal. 73.12. <hi>Their ſeede it eſtabliſhed in their ſight, and their generation before their eyes,</hi> Iob 21.8: But will it be euer ſo? <hi>Iob</hi> ſayeth, <hi>The candle of the wicked ſhall bee put out, their eyes ſhall ſee their destruction, and they ſhall drinke of the wrath of the Almighty,</hi> ver. 17.20, <hi>though there bee no changes in their life, nor bands in their death,</hi> Pſal 73.4, and though their branch bee greene, yet ſhall they bee cut off before their day, <hi>Iob</hi> 15.32, that is, ſooner then they thinke, the flame ſhall drye vp their branch, v. 30 &amp; when their night is once come, where are they?

But they gather that which the Text neuer ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; and it would bee remembred, that theſe words are the words of a Parable, and not of a thing done; the drift whereof is (as may appeare by the anſwer made, or ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee made) plainely to proue, that they who in this life refuſe to giue credite to the Scriptures and word of God, may hope in vaine to bee called by men from the dead.

An hearkning eare, and an vnderſtanding heart muſt go together; for the eare is the furrow that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth the doctrine of the word, and it works not but by hearing. Chriſt ſayth, and the ſame ſayth the Spirit in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Texts of the Reuelation: He that hath eares to heare: hee ſayth not, hee that hath eyes to ſee, and what muſt hee doe? not ſee a Stage furniſhed for a Play in the Maſſe; but heare what the Spirit will ſay, to witte, by his Word and Miniſters to the Congregation, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.7.11.17.29. &amp; 3.6.13.22.

                  <hi>The Reaſons.</hi> As a mans mind is not knowne but by ſpeaking; ſo neyther can wee know Gods will but by his word; nor what is in his word, but by hearing: Therefore God is ſay de to ſpeake in his word, and ſpeeches are to be taken with the eare, and no other wayes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.12. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the eare is the conduit of knowledge to the ſoule; and ſo, of ſauing knowledge to it. Thirdly, they that thirſt, muſt come to Chriſt, as they that want common water come to the well, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.37: but this well is deepe, and our eares are the buckets to draw with, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4, 11. Therefore when wee come to this well of liuing waters, wee muſt bring our eares (theſe buckets) with vs. Fourthly, when a Maſter ſpeaketh, he will looke to be heard. God ſpake by his Prophets in the<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 1.1.</note> old Teſtament, and by his Sonne in the new; did hee not ſpeake to bee heard? or ſhall wee not cauſe our eares to heare? and can the Lord of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple take it well, if we refuſe to heare the Maſter of his owne family? Fiftly, the word of Scripture is called the <hi>Power of God to ſaluation,</hi> Rom. 1.16; that is, his arme reuealed, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.1, to ſaue all that ſhall bee ſaued in deede.

               <p>The duty therefore of all Chriſtian Churches &amp; people is to heare the Word, that is the written word of God:<label type="milestone">

               <p>Secondly, this maketh againſt Popiſh Churches and people, in whoſe eares the word ſoundeth not, but in a ſtrange tongue: and teacheth that they who liue in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, liue in a wretched bondage of ignorance and ſinne, to which the Diuell hath captiued their eares and whole man. Neyther can they doe any thing ſo long as they continue ſuch, that will bee pleaſing to God. Further, this maketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt two ſorts of Recuſants in our land, the Popiſh, and thoſe of the Separation. And is it not a reproofe of many of our owne profeſſion, who on our Saboth dayes, neyther ſhew themſelues diligent, nor well diſpoſed hearers? For though they doe not turne their backes vpon vs, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe; yet they looke vpon our Aſſemblies with little or no zeale, and ſome with <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ſet vp Idols of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe againſt them, and thinke it too farre, or much to bee at them euery Sabboth day, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 12.28.29.

               <p>It pleaſed not this Rich man, that his rich brethren, drowned in wealth, &amp; in the delights of life, ſhould heare the word at the mouth of any of Gods ordinary Miniſters, whom he knew they would deſpiſe: and therefore, or becauſe he would bee contrary to <hi>Abraham</hi> and teach him, not learne of him; he maintaineth ſtill his firſt wicked po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition &amp; principle, which was, that one preaching to them from the dead, would doe more good vpon them for true conuerſion, then all the Preachers liuing could. And therfore he ſayth, <hi>Nay father Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> or not ſo, but as I ſay, and as I rather wiſh; who neuer loued this teaching by the Word, whether dwelling on earth, or damned in hell. Indeede the way which God by his ordinance hath commaunded for ſaluation to men, is the hearing of his Word by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; but that way is not ſufficient, or I had not beene here: and if hee would giue way for this (that I ſpeake of,) my fiue brethren ſhould not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:4441:68"/>come hither. Thus in effect hee reaſoneth againſt God, in ſpeaking to <hi>Abraham,</hi> rather then hee will confeſſe the way hee hath followed, and would preſcribe to others, to bee (as indeede it is) deceitfull, and to deſtruction.</p>
               <p>From hence learne,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> that the nature of the wicked is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to charge God, then themſelues for ſinne. So doe they whom Chriſt will ſet on the left hand of damnation, in his laſt iudgement: for, they ſay, <hi>When ſaw wee thee an hungred, or athirſt, or a ſtranger, or naked, or ſicke, or in priſon, and did not miniſter vnto thee?</hi> Math. 25.44: as if they had ſayde, Thou chargeſt vs that wee ſaw thee hungry and thirſty, &amp; without clothes, and in ſickneſſe, and priſon, and did not helpe thee? but when did wee euer ſee thee in ſuch ſtraites and want, and withdrew our hand of helpe from thee? And therefore we haue wrong to be ſo charged, and the thing is not true.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Adam</hi> blamed God for giuing him no better a wife, not himſelfe for following in euill, when hee ſhould haue led in goodneſſe. The woman, ſayth he, which thou gaueſt to be with mee, to wit, as my wife &amp; helper, Gen. 3.12. Thus alſo moſt vile reprobates impute their damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Gods will that cannot be reſiſted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19. And that reprobate that hid his talent, ſayde, I knew that thou waſt an hard man, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.14, ſpeaking againſt Gods ſeuerity, but nothing of his own ſinne. So they ſayd that Gods wayes were not equall, who themſelues were equall no way, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.29: The like we reade of <hi>Cain:</hi> for he when God reproued him for the bloud of his brother, ſpeakes not of his great murther, but of his ouer hard pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. He thought that God was too ſharpe and ſpake too ſeuerely to him for it. It is plaine therfore, that it is the nature of the wicked to blame God, and not blame worthy man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Reaſons.</hi> Wicked men are proud by nature, and proud men will bee in no fault. Secondly, the Deuils chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (ſuch as the wicked bee) are contrary to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and therefore where they iuſtifie the Lord, theſe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:4441:68"/>themſelues. Thirdly, the wicked, beeing his children who abode not in the truth, and whoſe name is ſlaunderer; muſt needes do his works, and ſay as hee will haue them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.44. Fourthly, ſuch men are the vowed enemies of God: and what care ſuch what they ſay of him, and how they charge him.</p>
               <p>Here then we ſee whoſe children,<label type="milestone">

                  </label> and children of what ſtocke and parentage they are, who complaine of God, when they ſhould giue him glory in his iudgements. They are not of the houſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> neyther haue they <hi>Dauids</hi> ſpirit in them: for, he confeſſed his fault, that God might be iuſtified in his ſayings, and pure when he iudgeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. He blamed not God, when he had told him by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> That euill ſhould be rayſed againſt him out of his own houſe, that the ſword of death ſhould ſtrike it, that his wiues ſhould be defiled, &amp; that the child ſhould die, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.11; but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth, as it was, that he had deſerued no leſſe, &amp; that God in ſo doing, was holy, righteous and iuſt, <hi>v.</hi> 13. Nor did <hi>Eli</hi> charge God when he threatned the deſtruction of his houſe by young <hi>Samuel,</hi> but ſubſcribed, that he might iuſtly do what <hi>Samuel</hi> had ſayd, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18: for, ſayth he, It is the Lord who can do nothing but wel. And with him ſubſcribed <hi>Hezechiah</hi> in a like meſſage ſent him from God, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 20.19. But what did <hi>Herod</hi> when <hi>Iohn</hi> reproued him? He could not beare the rebuke of his mouth, but ſent him to Warde for beeing ſo bolde with the King, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.17. So the Iewes, when <hi>Steuen</hi> iuſtly charged them, in ſtead of iuſtifying the Lord in that iuſt reproofe, they rather iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied themſelues in their wickedneſſe, and in madneſſe ran vpon him, and with ſtones murthered him, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51.57. And what ſhall we ſay of our owne times? when Gods hand lyes vpon vs in ſome generall or priuate ſtrokes for ſin: doe we confeſſe our ſins, and that God in viſiting for them is righteous? or do we not rather murmur, and take on in the affliction, as if he dealt hardly, or too cruelly with vs in ſmiting ſo for ſo ſmall matters? Doe we ſay as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> O Lord, righteouſnes belongeth vnto thee, and to vs
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:4441:69"/>open ſhame, or the confuſion of our faces? <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.7: or doe we not rather breake out by impatience and bitter cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, at the leaſt by fretting againſt God, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudgments, as too galling and rigorous? The condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that is of themſelues, ſome haue learned here of a damned ſoule in hell to transferre, not iuſtly vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but vniuſtly vpon God, that they haue wrong to be damned: for, ſay they, how can we chuſe, when God will haue it ſo? <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19.</p>
               <p>But this Rich man knew by himſelfe, that the loue of the word could finde no entrance where the loue of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſures had filled the heart: ſo it had in his fiue bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and therfore he was perſwaded that all labor of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching by the word ſhould be in vaine and loſt vpon them.</p>
               <p>And here we ſecondly learne,<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> that worldly couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and voluptuous life quench in natural men all deſire of ſaluation by the Word: for ſuch will not come to the Aſſemblies with the bidden gueſts, who abſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by their Farmes and yokes of oxen from it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.18.19: or if they come, they are ſure to come without all affection of hearing thither; &amp; their mind goeth after their couetouſneſſe, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33.31. Their wits are ſo exerciſed &amp; taken vp with thoughts about worldly things, that they haue neyther leaſure nor mind to attend to the word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, or hauing ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t all edge (this way) before they come: being come, they fall aſleepe when they ſhould heare; or if they be awake, and liſten a little, they haue neither loue nor liking to that which is taught.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Reaſons.</hi> Worldly riches and voluptuous life are thornes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.14; as therefore thorns make the ſowne fields vnfruitfull, ſo the thorns ofriches and voluptuous life make the word where it is taught vnprofitable Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, theſe are enmity to God, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4 4, and what enemy will not in corruption, doe all he can to deſtroy his enemie? Thirdly, they that follow theſe luſts are called, if they bee men, adulterers, and if women, adultereſſes, <hi>I am.</hi> 4.4: not corporall, but ſpirituall, which is farre worſe; for corporall
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:4441:69"/>adultery is againſt the ſecond Table; but this is againſt God in the firſt; and a man may be a corporall Adulterer, as <hi>Dauid,</hi> and yet not hate God: but hee that goes a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from him by a worldly and couetous heart, cannot but ſtand vp againſt him, as the hater of him, and enemy of his couenant.</p>

For, when they perceiue them to abuſe vnto wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, a full allowance, they will draw back their hand in a ſparer portion. So God, perceiuing his <hi>children</hi> (becauſe they be <hi>full-fed</hi>) wantonly to take pleaſure in the gauds &amp; faſhions of this world, doeth therefore many times keepe them low, &amp; denie them that ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty of theſe worldly things

                  <hi>Ahraham</hi> perceiuing that words could not ſatisfie this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate &amp; <hi>cuntentious rich-man,</hi> breaks off al further talke with him, and leaues him; telling him (at parting) which he had tolde him before, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets muſt be heard to ſaluation; and that not beleeuing the Word, it is impoſſible to beleeue without it, though men ſhould come from the dead vnto vs. And thus hee concludes the Parable, and all ſpeech with this rich man in it. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is that which already was ſpoken of; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition thereof is ſafe for vs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.1: for, beſides that it ſtands vpon a ſure ground of truth; it is auouched twice, the better to aſſure vs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.32. And it teacheth that there is no perſwading of him that will not bee perſwaded by the Word written. Therefore ſayd the counterfeit <hi>Samuel</hi> to reprobate <hi>Saul: Wherefore doeſt thou aske of me, ſeeing the Lord is gone from thee?</hi> 1. Sam. 28.16. as if he had ſayde, How ſhall I perſwade thee, when God by his word can
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:4441:72"/>not? and what anſwer can I make when his Prophets will make mone? v. 15. So <hi>Ieremie, They haue reiected the word of the Lord, and what wiſedome is in them?</hi> Ier. 8.9, that is, the word cannot teach them, and what then ſhall teach them wiſedome? Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking of the ordinances and lawes which God had commaunded, telleth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that to keepe and do them is their wiſdome, <hi>Deut:</hi> 4.5.6. his meaning is, that if they will be <hi>truly wiſe,</hi> or made wiſe vnto <hi>ſaluation,</hi> it muſt be by the ordinances &amp; lawes writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: or, if not by theſe, by nothing. And Chriſt ſends the <hi>Iewes</hi> to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to <hi>ſearch them:</hi> not to dead mens graues, to rake in them. <hi>Ioh:</hi> 5, 39. As if he had ſayde, eyther there, or no where. For, to reſolue the <hi>Iewes,</hi> concerning <hi>Him, whome the Father ſent:</hi> what could do it ſooner, or ſo well as the <hi>Word,</hi> that is <hi>mightie</hi> in operation, <hi>liuely</hi> for edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication? <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 4.12. <hi>The reaſons.</hi> Firſt, nothing is written in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the ſcriptures, that is not written in the heart of nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14.15. And what <hi>naturall Man</hi> doeth not confeſſe the effect of the Law, as that which is ſo deepely engrauen in him, that he cannot rubb it out-by any pretences or colours to the contrary? Secondly, the <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes</hi> that went before, are daily fulfilled. And what will they <hi>beleeue</hi> who ſhal doubt of that which they haue <hi>heard,</hi> which they haue <hi>ſeene</hi> with their eies, and which <hi>(euen)</hi> their hands, in ſome ſort <hi>haue handled</hi> of the word <hi>of life?</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1, 1. But all theſe are contained in the <hi>word</hi> written: and (therefore) they that refuſe to heare it, what wil they heare? Thirdly, it is ſafe to heare <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; the other writings of <hi>holy men</hi> in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but ſafe no way (<hi>Sathan</hi> transforming himſelfe (as hee doth) into an angel <hi>of light.</hi>) to leane vnto things not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: or reſt vpon vn written vanities, taken vp vpon credite, of ſatha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the father, as of lyers, ſo of lies, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.44. and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath God giuen vs a moſt ſure <hi>word of the Prophetes,</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 19. but that we ſhold not leaue a certainty, for an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie: or goe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which will ſurely leade vs in our way, to that which wil be ſure to lead vs out? Fourthly, the <hi>word</hi> written containeth the promiſes of <hi>a moſt excellent life,</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:4441:72"/>and that <hi>Sternall</hi> in heauen: alſo the threatnings of a moſt intollerable death, and that <hi>euerlaſting in the hells.</hi> If then, a ſhort life of pleaſures, ſhort and vaine, ſo moue vs: how can we but be moued with the <hi>long life</hi> of thoſe pleaſures, that <hi>are for euer?</hi> And if wee be ſo much troubled to heare of <hi>death</hi> (which in ſome ends all paines, and beginnes all ioyes that haue no end) how can that but ſhake all our bones, as with a moſt violent wind, that ſpeaketh of the death that is endles; which all reprobates die, &amp; are neuer dead? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not to be moued with all this, what can moue vs? So it is ſealed vp for a ſure truth, that what the word of God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not do, that no word of <hi>man</hi> or <hi>Angell</hi> can doe. They that will not be healed by it, are <hi>incurable;</hi> ſo ſaith my text: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wil they be perſwaded, thogh <hi>one roſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>the dead again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A terrour to thoſe that cannot be perſwaded by the <hi>word,</hi> whether <hi>Atheiſts</hi> in life, or opinion. For,<label type="milestone">

And they that ſo doe, what can perſwade them but the Magiſtrates ſtaffe? and what anſwer muſt be made them, but ſilence? 2. <hi>Kings,</hi> 18, 36. How wretched then is the condition of thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh poore people that cannot come at the word, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by it, and of their popiſh <hi>leaders,</hi> that thinke to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade without it? And, what doe ſuch, but <hi>bury Chriſt</hi> in ſtead of being buryed with Chriſt? alſo, by making igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>deuotion</hi> (which is the <hi>ſtep-mother</hi> of <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>) what do they but keepe him ſtill in his graue?

So ſhal we bee partakers of thoſe ioyes, which <hi>Lazarus</hi> hath in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4441:73"/>boſome, and eſcape the torments, and place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherein <hi>Abraham</hi> left this <hi>Rich-man,</hi> and wee leaue him.
